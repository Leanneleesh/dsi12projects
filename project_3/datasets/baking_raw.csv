,AskBaking,"Hello! I'm a first time user here and a relatively new baker. Be gentle with me, please!

I baked the Tartine Devil's Food Layer Cake last night. Even though I followed the directions very closely, I ended up with a dense, under baked brick when I turned it out this morning. 

When I rebaked this afternoon, I used an oven thermometer, made sure the temp was correct, re batched the cake from scratch, and baked again, only this time I made sure to leave it in until the tester came out clean. It seemed alright until I started cutting the layers. The edges of the cake were nearly burned, the bottom was thick and tough, and inside was basically wet fudge it was so raw.

Any ideas on where I could have gone wrong?  


[Recipe](http://kitchenfiddler.blogspot.com/2014/03/devils-food-cake-with-caramel-la.html) for reference, though this isn't quite the same. Instead of all purpose flour, the recipe in the book (Tartine Classics) calls for a mixture of all purpose, Einkorn, and dark rye flours. (115g, 100g, 70g respectively).

UPDATE:

I’ve now baked the cake a second time. Before I baked I tested the oven with a thermometer in different areas, and while there were definitely some differences there wasn’t anything drastic. 

So, I baked at 325*F convect for 45 mins and the cakes were still super raw when I tested them. I ended up baking for a total of 65 mins and pulled them out to find the edges burned and the middle raw again.

,AskBaking,"Hello. Hoping /r/askbaking can help me out. My absolute favorite way to medicate with cannabis is with Kiva Terra Bites in the blueberry variety (apologies if this sort of thing isn’t allowed here - the medicated part is pretty irrelevant). Unfortunately, even though I live in a legal state they are not available here, so I was hoping to make some at home. Caveat: I’m absolutely horrible at baking/candy making because I never really do it. 

Edit 2: I now realize that “panning” is the process by which the blueberries are coated. No idea that was a thing but assuming I can’t do that at home without expensive equipment. Any suggestions on similar alternatives that are easy to make?

I have no idea how I would make a round shaped bite like this with a blueberry inside. Is there a mold, or does the manufacturer likely use a special machine?  If this isn’t possible at home is there an easier form I can use to accomplish something similar?

Here is the website for reference: https://kivaconfections.com/products/bites/bites-blueberry

The description: Blueberry Terra Bites are the latest innovation in our line of best-selling Terra Bites. Using a traditional 24-hour panning process, dried US-grown blueberries are dusted with cocoa powder and finished with a generous coating of delicious milk chocolate.

Hoping &lt;a href=""/r/askbaking""&gt;/r/askbaking&lt;/a&gt; can help me out. My absolute favorite way to medicate with cannabis is with Kiva Terra Bites in the blueberry variety (apologies if this sort of thing isn’t allowed here - the medicated part is pretty irrelevant). Unfortunately, even though I live in a legal state they are not available here, so I was hoping to make some at home. Caveat: I’m absolutely horrible at baking/candy making because I never really do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I now realize that “panning” is the process by which the blueberries are coated. No idea that was a thing but assuming I can’t do that at home without expensive equipment. Any suggestions on similar alternatives that are easy to make?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how I would make a round shaped bite like this with a blueberry inside. Is there a mold, or does the manufacturer likely use a special machine?  If this isn’t possible at home is there an easier form I can use to accomplish something similar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the website for reference: &lt;a href=""https://kivaconfections.com/products/bites/bites-blueberry""&gt;https://kivaconfections.com/products/bites/bites-blueberry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description: Blueberry Terra Bites are the latest innovation in our line of best-selling Terra Bites. Using a traditional 24-hour panning process, dried US-grown blueberries are dusted with cocoa powder and finished with a generous coating of delicious milk chocolate. Each 5MG bite is polished to sweet, tart, irresistible, perfection.

,AskBaking,"Hello, I'm looking for recommendations for a nice mixer for my wife.

Just before Christmas Costco had the 6 qt. KitchenAid Pro mixer for $249 ($80 off their normal price), so we jumped on it. After using it a few times, my wife felt that it was too much mixer for her (the bowl was too big for making small batches of dough and she didn't like the bowl lift mechanism), so we returned it last night.

I'd like her to get something nice but have seen others on this subreddit recommend against KitchenAid due to quality control issues.

We are looking for a tilt-head mixer in the 4-5 quart range. She will mainly be making cookies, cakes and frostings with it, but could potentially get into bread making. She likes the idea of being able to use the KitchenAid add-on attachments, so we consider that a plus but not necessarily a must-have.

,AskBaking,"Hello,

AskBaking folks. I tried to search the internet, and later also this sub for an answer to this question so that I wouldn't have to ask it but alas I couldn't find anything.

What I'm looking for are ideas on how to make streusel that takes longer to bake. Like, an hour long or even a bit longer.

I'm generally considered good at baking by those around me, and it is to at least a degree true as I can do weird and/or horrible things to recipes and have nice results, but the best idea I could come up with here is making dense dough that I freeze and then grind. And not only is this something that takes way more time time (about an hour in the fridge, then another one plus some freezing) but I'm also worried that I may have gone beyond where reasonable alterations go and into the realm of insane ideas. And making standard streusel, baking it separately from the cake, and then merging them together at the end ... it doesn't really work unless I glue them together unless the cake itself is gluey (which isn't the case often) and making edible glue just isn't cost-effective for me (no local availability of certain ingredients outside of speciality stores with frankly ridiculous mark-up).

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

,AskBaking,"First, I'd like to apologise if this is the wrong subreddit. If it is, please direct me where I should be asking this!

There's this family recipe for dough, that we use for apple pies and mince pies. My father got it from his mother, who (iirc) got it from her mother, and obviously, if I ever have children, they'll get it from me. But it's a fairly unusual recipe, and I've never encountered a recipe like it anywhere else. The ingredients are:

&amp;#x200B;

1/2 lb flour

1/4 lb unsalted butter

3/4 cups sugar

3 heaped tablespoons of baking powder

1 egg, beaten up

&amp;#x200B;

What you end up with is a dough that is very sweet and also, due to the large quantities of baking powder, kind of fizzy. It sounds weird, but it's delicious--as long as you use a baking powder formulated without disodium phosphate. We use one that has monocalcium phosphate, because a baking powder with disodium phosphate would render the whole recipe quite salty.

,AskBaking,"I made fudge yesterday and it tastes great, but there's one issue. After two hours of letting it sit in the fridge and harden, I brought it out and it had this weird liquid accumulating on the edges/corners. The fudge still wasn't near hard enough either, so I put it back in. I took it out today and it's now rock hard and the liquid has solidified and turned a whiteish yellowish color. There's a little bit of it on the surface of parts of the fudge now, too, not just the edges/corners.

I *think* this might be because I used too much butter in the pan. The recipe said to put tin foil in a metal pan, but we didn't have tin foil that would work, so my mom looked up what other recipes did and then told me to use butter to grease a glass pan and put it in there. Would that be what's accumulating on the edges? I'm kind of confused why it's on the surface too if that's it. Should I just only ever use tin foil in the future? 

Also, I want to ship fudge to someone across the country soon. I noticed that the fudge is rock hard when it's in the fridge but softens up to be squishy (but not melting) if I leave some out for a while. Is that normal? Is it going to rot in the mail if it gets warm enough in transit to get soft?

,AskBaking,"Hi! Follow up question to one I posted last night - u/weirdoughz was incredible and directed me to Cooking Tree on youtube, and I've decided I want to essentially make this [peach mousse cake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeGupB528L8), which has jelly suspended in the middle, *but* I want to make 1.5x the mousse recipe, then include 2 layers of cake (instead of one) and want to split the jelly into 2 separate flavours.

I was just wondering what some tried and true fruit combinations for cake were? I think I want to keep the peach, since it's summer here in Australia and peach is quite a light flavour, but I'm unsure of whether there's another fruit that would compliment peach without overwhelming it - I'm planning to still keep the mousse peach, and just make one of the jelly layers and then the thin layer of mousse on top flavoured differently to prevent that. My other thought was maybe to ditch the peach and do an orange and grapefuit combo, as citrus is also quite refreshing?

Another question too (sorry); in the video they use a sponge cake - would I be able to use a chiffon cake instead?? I absolutely love love love how light it is, and think it would help make it a really light cake overall, but aren't sure if the gelatin in the mousse has enough structural integrity to prevent it from crushing the cake into a pancake

&lt;p&gt;I was just wondering what some tried and true fruit combinations for cake were? I think I want to keep the peach, since it&amp;#39;s summer here in Australia and peach is quite a light flavour, but I&amp;#39;m unsure of whether there&amp;#39;s another fruit that would compliment peach without overwhelming it - I&amp;#39;m planning to still keep the mousse peach, and just make one of the jelly layers and then the thin layer of mousse on top flavoured differently to prevent that. My other thought was maybe to ditch the peach and do an orange and grapefuit combo, as citrus is also quite refreshing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question too (sorry); in the video they use a sponge cake - would I be able to use a chiffon cake instead?? I absolutely love love love how light it is, and think it would help make it a really light cake overall, but aren&amp;#39;t sure if the gelatin in the mousse has enough structural integrity to prevent it from crushing the cake into a pancake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for any help!&lt;/p&gt;

So it’s about 3:30am where I am and I’ve just made my gingerbread dough and have got it chilling overnight, except just as I was about finished combining wet and dry I realized that at the start I only used a half cup of butter when really it should have been a whole cup, so as a Hail Mary attempt at saving the precious cookies I added the rest of the butter and made sure it was as combined as possible...

Basically how badly have I messed up? Should I just scrap and start over, or should I give baking them a whirl and see what happens?

,AskBaking,"I am wanting to make a chocolate bundt cake with an inner peppermint layer cooked into the cake and not a filling where I scoop out holes and pipe it in.  I'm not finding much online that is exactly what I had in mind. The closest I have found is this recipe: [https://cookiesandcups.com/fudge-filled-vanilla-bundt-cake/](https://cookiesandcups.com/fudge-filled-vanilla-bundt-cake/) where the cake is vanilla and the filling is chocolate/fudge.

I have read that, in general, you can subsitute about 1/4 of the flour in a vanilla mix with cocoa powder, but some say that makes it too dry.  One person suggested simply adding 3 tbsp of cocoa powder and 100g melted dark chocolate without removing any flour.  my dual concerns are not making the cake too dry and keeping the batter thick enough to support the inner layer.

As for said inner layer, the original recipe calls for cream cheese, melted chocolate chips and an egg.  I was thinking I could simply replace the chocolate chips with melted down peppermint bark.  I may add a little peppermint exract and a few drops of red food dye to give it a nice candy cane pink.  

Finishing off with the glaze as-is plus a drop of peppermint extract and crushed candy cane instead of chocolate chips.

&lt;p&gt;So I come to you humble and in need: what are your favorite light and fluffy buttercream recipes? Any tips for getting it right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

I've just tried my hand at baking some ginger cookies (my first cookies baked on my own ever actually) ; I used brown sugar, fresh grated ginger, chopped crystallized ginger, kerrygold butter, the works.

,AskBaking,"Hi everybody! I need some advice on building a gingerbread figure. Instead of a house, I want to build a figure (don't want to ""reveal"" yet what exactly it is, but I promise to post it here if I succeed^^. It's also not something most people will be familiar with).  Basically, it consists of 2 big pieces, which are triangular, and stuck together along the longest sides - forming a diamond. The hard part starts here: The figure must be standing upwards, ever so slightly leaning back. Obviously it won't stand just like that, but the lower part of the diamond will be supported by several small ""legs"", and it can also be slightly leaning on something for extra support, which however should be only about 1/4th of the length of the diamond.

I hope [this awesome painting here](https://imgur.com/3LBHqE8) helps depict how I want this thing to look like.... :D (the white stuff is just frosting) x)
Now the question is how to actually do that...
I already tried it few years back, by securing the two triangles with each other by sticking them together with several toothpicks. That even worked pretty well. Obviously however, i couldn't manage do keep it standing upwards, as either the whole thing would fall over, split along the middle, or the legs would fall off (that's the second hard part, how to keep the small legs from breaking/ falling off under the weight of the diamond).

,AskBaking,"Hi All!

I'm having a christmas party with friends on the first, and have decided that making massive levain-style cookies (bakery in NY) is worth the the undertaking, despite the extra cost and effort of less cookies on each sheet. Because it's christmas related, I've decided to cut the walnuts (also I'm a poor student) but add a peppermint flavour, and was wondering which way you guys thought was the best way to do so. Currently I know of 3;

1) Add crushed up candy canes. This, IMO, potentially leads to ruined texture because crispiness is overtaken by crunchiness and lolly getting stuck in your teeth

2) Add peppermint extra to the dough itself - I'm worried about a 'toothpaste' like effect occuring if I do this though (I've never had any cake or dough before that's peppermint flavoured, and I think there' s a good reason why)

3) Add some peppermint chocolate in with the normal milk chocolate.

The 3rd option is, faily obviously, the one I'm leaning toward, but I honestly haven't tried any of the above, and the cheapest peppermint chocolate I know of (Lindt) is still fairly pricey.

,AskBaking,"Ive been trying to make croissants and i've looked at a lot of recipes and notice a wide variety between them with regards to the dough. Not so much the ratio difference but the different ingredients.

I notice a combination of these 3 ingredients, water, milk and butter. Some ingredients add all 3 some only add 2/3.
My question is, is there a difference in the dough in terms of how all 3 ingredients interact?

Currently I've been using this [recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGHmecm7_iU) and i notice the dough is really tough to roll, like im applying a lot of force just to flatten it. So it got me wondering if I can improve the dough to make it softer.

I'm working on making a second batch of [Bon Appetit's ""Best Morning Buns""](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-morning-buns) recipe, but was looking to make a change or two. 

specifically, the recipe calls for a (relatively) small amount of whole wheat flour. in tasting my initial bake, I think I'd prefer the buns *without* the whole wheat flour, but I'm not entirely sure the best way to go about this. 

a lot of the articles I've read online (almost all of which talk going from AP/bread ---&gt; whole wheat) say that there's a rough ratio of 1 cup AP/bread to 3/4ths cup whole wheat, but that you also need to add a small amount of liquid (water/milk/whatever) when making this switch. 

does it stand to reason that going from whole wheat --&gt; AP/bread means that you slightly increase the amount of AP/bread flour and slightly decrease the amount of liquid? 

put more bluntly, would the ""correct"" substitution in this case be: 

1 cup whole wheat flour --&gt; 1 and 1/3rd cup AP

,AskBaking,"Hello everyone,

I like to bring baked goods in to work to share with coworkers and my cookies have earned me a reputation. The recipe I use is just this one:

     
    2 1/4 cups all purpose flour
    1 teaspoon baking soda
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
    3/4 cup brown sugar
    1/4 cup granulated sugar
    3.4 ounces vanilla instant pudding mix
    2 large eggs
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
     
    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
    In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda and salt and set aside.
    Using a stand or electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on high speed until light and creamy, at least 3 minutes. Do not skip this step. Once combined, add the pudding mix, vanilla and eggs and beat on high for 2-3 minutes.
    Slowly add half of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and turn the mixer on low to start so the flour doesn't get everywhere. Turn the mixer up to high and mix until combined. Add the rest of the dry ingredients and repeat until dough is just combined. Add chocolate chips and stir with a rubber spatula until incorporated.
    Drop cookies by 1/4 cup onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until slightly golden and just set on the top. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for two minutes then transfer to a baking rack to cool completely.

These are pudding cookies, with a packet of instant pudding mix added after creaming the butter and sugar. They usually come out very nicely, with good size, shape, and they don't fall flat at all. Beautiful cookies.

&amp;#x200B;

I've now been challenged by another engineer to have a ""cookie off"" and our coworkers will be judges. The only thing at stake here is my reputation. So I'm wondering if you guys can think of anything that might help this recipe produce the best cookies it can? Some things I've already thought of:

1. Use butter with higher fat content (kerrygold) (not sure if this will help or hurt when it comes to cookies, plan on experimenting today)
2. Use cage free eggs
3. King Arthur flour
4. Jello brand instant pudding mix (usually use store brand because cheaper)
5. Real vanilla extract (usually use artificial)

Also I plan on really paying attention to creaming the butter and sugar together for the appropriate amount of time (\~3 minutes?) and being sure not to overmix the dough.

TL;DR: what can I do to make these cookies the best they can be.

,AskBaking,"Long one here, bear with me because I could use a little help from my fellow mad scientists on this. 

Someone I know has a fairly severe case of Lyme disease, and as such has been put on a very restricted diet. Her restrictions include being limited to only spelt or millet flours, and nothing with yeast. Yeast appears to be a complication because the antibiotics and other medications for Lyme disease can cause the person's digestive tract to be overrun with yeasts and fungus, and that in turn can have all manner of complications.

So here's me trying to make a half-way decent loaf of bread for her, and my first attempt was just a quick bread.
I tried a 100% spelt flour quick bread leavened with baking soda and acid (the acid in this case coming from an improvised buttermilk made of oat milk and lemon juice because she also isn't supposed to have real milk).
It was ok. Basically a bread, but unremarkable.

My concern with quick breads is that they don't really process the flours at all. The slow fermentation of a good sourdough bread is what makes flours so easily digestible, and friggin delicious. 

I can improve the flavoring and nutrition a little with some additions to the quick bread, like oats and maybe a little almond flour, but if anyone happens to have better ideas I would love to hear them. 

As a side-note, I'm not entirely clear why yeasted breads should be prohibited in this case. A well-baked loaf often comes out of the over near 100 C, maybe 205-210 F for the imperial folks, well beyond the 60 C (140 F) that is takes to pasteurize yeast.

I'm in the US, so I've used almond flour, powdered sugar, and large egg whites. I'm baking this for a smaller crowd, so I've halved the recipe.

When I mixed 250g almond flour, 250g powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp almond extract, and two egg whites, the dough would not come together. It was crumbly-- I could squeeze a handful to make a turd-shaped log, but I couldn't roll it out at all. I stuck it in the fridge hoping the chill would help, but it did not.

It felt low on moisture, so I added another egg white, and got it so I could sorta pinch and roll it out. I did freestanding rings rather than use a mold because I didn't care toooo much about precision, but the dough was still very crumbly and hard to work with.

Here was the final product: https://imgur.com/ADYwdTj . It was still moist on the inside-- is that correct, texture-wise? I was worried that 10 minutes was not very long to bake them.

I'm a french baker and I would like to know how you are doing for bake moist muffin. I'm trying a shit ton of recipe I found on the internet and I always end up unhappy. I think my muffins are not moist enough.

But maybe the problem is I don't know what mean moist ?

When you said muffins are so moist, does it mean the mouthfeel is watery after a bite ? (this is how I understood moist)

I'm not using butter, i'm using colza oil instead. I think it's better for this kind of pastry (butter normally after a while should leave a more dry feeling, which is not what I'm looking for). What do you guys think ?

I'm using buttermilk and 50% of white sugar (baker percentage). I take care to not overmix. I'm baking at very high temperature for the beginning and then reduce drastically. Maybe the high temperature burst is making my muffin not moist enough ?

Should I have to increase the hydration or it's not necessary ?

&lt;p&gt;Most of a Cristo shortening from Costco Canada &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half a tub of margarine (2 cups?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2L of vanilla almond milk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12 eggs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 avocados &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 medium bananas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4lbs of dry chickpeas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking I would just make a lot of banana chocolate chip muffins? But is there a way to use the shortening and not waste the margarine I have left on baking? Also, what other recipes can I make with what I have? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only have $15 left and no job so if you don&amp;#39;t see something, feel free to ask if I have it because I might have forgotten, but I really won&amp;#39;t be able to buy anything else since that $15 needs to go towards toothpaste and toilet paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I also have a large bag of cocoa powder so I added that to the list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: and 2 large bags of chickpeas that I was just going to roast but if you have a better idea let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

,AskBaking,"I'm planning on making a vegan cheesecake using extra firm silken tofu and a form of fat instead of cream cheese. [The recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/drmngg/when_the_cheesecake_comes_out_smooth_as_a_babys/f6jsgxe?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) I'm using as a reference is pretty standard.

I'm paying attention to the proportions of fat:carbs:protein, as well as liquid contributed from each ingredient, from this recipe, so after subbing by weight the tofu, there remains \~300g of fat to be added. Daiya's New York style ""cheezecake"" uses primarily coconut cream which I found to be very convincing, but I'm more familiar with using coconut oil and am leaning toward that.  

The main potential issue I see with this, other than the high likelihood of the emulsion either not forming or breaking, is that there is a \*lot\* more protein. Like \~130g extra.  

I can't find any information on the effects of such an excess of protein in a recipe like this. Any thoughts on how it may affect the batter and the bake would be really appreciated!

,AskBaking,"As a follow up to my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/dqcmez/when_europeans_say_corn_flour_do_they_mean_corn/), I'm sad to report that my first attempt at creme patissiere resulted in failure.  I watched a tonne of YouTube videos and I confident that I had my technique down pat.  But I'll go over the recipe and steps I used, and I'd appreciate it if anyone can point out where I might have gone wrong

**RECIPE**

* 1 liter of whole milk
* 4 whole eggs
* 200g sugar
* 110g corn starch
* 1 whole vanilla pod

Recipe notes:  

* Most recipes just use egg yolks, but the one I followed used whole eggs.  Maybe the extra protein caused my coagulation problems?

* The recipe I followed used quite a bit of corn starch compared to other recipes I was looking at.  As an observation, recipes coming from French sources use a lot more corn starch than recipes coming from American sources.  Too much corn starch would also explain my coagulation problems.

**METHOD**

1) Heated milk, vanilla pod, and some sugar over medium heat (electric stovetop) in a heavy-bottomed stainless steel saucepan until it was just about boiling.  I whisked it the whole time, which I'm not sure if you are supposed to do.

2) Whisked together the sugar and corn starch.  Added that to my beaten eggs and whisked this mixture together.

3) Slowly added the hot milk mixture to the egg/sugar/starch mixture to temper the eggs.

4) Added the mix back to the original sauce pan that was on medium heat (electric stovetop).

5) Whisked the bejesus out of this mixture while it was heating up

6) Intended to wait for the pastry cream to come to a boil and then continue heating for 2 minutes before removing from heat and decanting to cool.

It's between steps 5 and 6 where everything went wrong.  As I was whisking the bejesus out of the pastry cream, its consistency changed to that of rubber in the span of about 3 seconds.  I've never seen this happen in any of the YouTube videos I've watched.

I've tried independently researching what might have gone wrong, but it seems that most problems with pastry cream is that it's too runny, or that it's too lumpy.  I wouldn't call mine lumpy per say, I'd call it rubbery.

I've gotten into making laminated dough. it's great! I've had a ton of success -- surprisingly -- and I've fallen in love with the fact that I can spend a little bit of time (... and a lot of waiting) to make some delicious snacks for friends and family. 

to say I'm still a student is an understatement -- I don't even feel like I've *started* being a student yet (I'm maybe at the ""look at different schools"" stage of my pastry making, if we want to continue with the college application metaphor). 

one question I've had has to do with the beurrage. I understand its role in the laminated dough, but I'm not sure I understand why so much effort is spent to effectively mash up the butter before constructing it. is there a chemical reason for doing this? is it introducing more air into the block or something? redistributing the fat and water inside the butter? 

part of me feels like it's just a holdover from way back when butter wasn't already sold in a block, but, as with all things pastry, I'm sure I'm missing something...

,AskBaking,"Dear baking gods, I'm about to attempt (or rather, I want to, and have apples sliced and oven warming) to replicate Dominique Ansel's apples only, layers of apple tarte tatin.  He has two versions of tarte tatin--this is the newer one.

Why?  Because it seems like, since it's mostly apples and sugar, it might be interesting to try!  The problem is, there aren't any recipe references online--only that he cooks it for a very long time slowly, and that there's caramel involved.  

&amp;#x200B;

My first attempt was a bit of a fail, I think because I put too much caramel and the whole thing was inedibly sweet (and the apples got very hard in the process.)  I did layer the apples--and cook it at 250 degrees for 4 hours.  But I think the basting and adding of more sugars went too far.

,AskBaking,"Hey all! I'm planning a cheesecake for my girlfriend's dad's birthday in a couple weeks, and am stuck on a couple of technical issues.

He loves pies and cheesecakes, so I thought it'd be cool to wrap a cheesecake in a traditional hot water crust, with a lid and all.

I thought I could go about this a couple of different ways:

1. Blind bake my crust in a springform mold, pour a layer of no-bake cheesecake, chill, then a layer of strawberry compote, chill, another layer of no-bake, chill, a layer of blueberry compote, chill, one last layer of no-bake. I just tested a no-bake cheesecake I wasn't thrilled with texturally - it was a little too soft and I'm not confident it'll hold up to so many layers structurally. I could go about this in a couple of other ways: 

a. find another no-bake recipe that's a little more reliable. I've seen Stella Parks/BraveTart's recipe on Serious Eats. Do you all think that will give me the structure I need to pull this off?

b. If no, I can add a little agar to the recipe. I want it sliceable but not gelatinous. I was thinking of doubling [this recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/07/no-bake-cheesecake-recipe.html) and adding maybe a tablespoon of agar. Does anyone have thoughts on if it's a bad idea, whether or not it's enough, whether or not it's too much?

The second way I was thinking about this was just, well, baking it like a cheesecake. I haven't baked a cheesecake without a waterbath before, and I'm concerned that a waterbath + a liquidy filling won't exactly help the crust bake or brown. It's a lot of filling, so I'm concerned about baking it *without* a waterbath and just curdling the heck out of the filling. To add insult to injury, my home oven isn't exactly super reliable. I'd love it if it worked like a pate en croute, but I just can't visualize it happening.

I wish I'd had time to practice this, but unfortunately, life happened and I've got one shot to get it right. Worst case scenario, I'll throw the whole thing in the garbage and make him a quick pie, but...I'd love to see this work.

,AskBaking,"I'm making a 9"" lime/mango version of Rose's Lemon Cranberry Tart Tart from The Baking Bible for a baking practical and want to include fresh ginger.  The filling is a lemon curd, but to test the recipe, I made it like a pastry cream instead (boiled sugar, butter, zest, 2 oz chopped ginger, and lime juice; created liaison with egg yolks and sugar; tempered and cooked to nappe).   I strained it then added a couple of sheets of gelatin to help it cut clean.  It came out great, but you can't taste any of the ginger.  I tried letting it steep for 15 minutes before I mixed it, but that clearly wasn't enough.

I have 2 days of class one week apart to make this.  I was going to make the tart dough the first week, then make the tart filling, a Swiss meringue and assemble it the second week.   Should I grate the ginger and combine it with soft butter and let it sit in the refrigerator (or freezer) from week 1 to week 2?

I strained it then added a couple of sheets of gelatin to help it cut clean.  It came out great, but you can&amp;#39;t taste any of the ginger.

,AskBaking,"Hello fellow bakers! 

I made my first ever batch of Millionaire's Shortbread Cookies two days ago and, while absolutely delicious, my shortbread came out super crumbly (it was my first time making shortbread too).  [I used this recipe to exact measurement, ](http://titlisbusykitchen.com/recipe/caramel-shortbread) but I only hand-worked my cookie dough until it came together and then pressed it into the bottom of the pan.

**ADVICE NEEDED: What can I do to make a stronger shortbread? More butter? Less flour? Work the dough longer? Different recipe? Any tips appreciated!**

P. s. It was my first time making caramel too, and the caramel I got from this recipe came out SO GOOD! I cooked it for 20 mins instead of 10 and I really liked the depth of flavor and color that came of it. I found it too sweet so I added a couple pinches of kosher salt and that helped.

Thank you in advance for any advice!

EDIT: The recipe-

Ingredients
For the shortbread:
250 g (9 oz) plain flour
175 g (6 oz) butter or margarine
75 g (2½ oz) caster sugar (or ordinary sugar)

For the caramel
400 g (14 oz) tin of condensed milk
150 g (5 oz) butter or margarine
150 g (5 oz) brown or white sugar

For the chocolate topping
200 g (7 oz) milk or plain chocolate.

Instructions
Prepare the shortbread base by mixing the flour and sugar in a bowl, then rubbing in the butter to produce a smooth paste-like dough.

Press the dough into an 8″x8″ (20cmx20cm) baking tin, or a Swiss Roll tin and smooth the surface with the back of a spoon.

Prick the dough with a fork and bake at 180°C for 20 minutes. Leave to cool in the tin.

Prepare the caramel by melting the butter gently in a pan. Add the sugar and stir until a “sludge” is formed.

Remove from the heat and stir in the condensed milk. Bring back to the boil and simmer gently with constant stirring for 8-10 minutes.

Pour the hot caramel onto the shortbread base, spread it out evenly then leave to cool completely.

Melt the chocolate in a glass bowl over a pan or boiling water. Pour onto the caramel and spread evenly. Place in the ‘fridge to harden the chocolate then cut into squares.

Titli's Tips

Don’t be tempted to cut into large squares! This is quite rich and is probably where the name Millionaires’ Shortbread comes from.

A deep tin helps to keep the edges neat until you are ready to cut it, but is not essential. Store in an airtight box in a cool place.",t2_hnlwi,False,,0,False,My shortbread came out too crumbly.

Hi there!

My girlfriend and I attempted to make the cookies from the basics with babish episode on chocolate chip cookies. We followed the recipe exactly (or almost!) but our cookies came out terribly wrong!

Right when they go in the oven, the butter? starts seeping out of the cookies and spreading. Ultimately it never cooks through all the way and is very doughy even when over cooked for a long time (we tried again the next night after the dough was left in the fridge all night).

The only thing that may have been different is we converted flour from 11.5 ounces to just over 2 cups since we did not have a scale.... also we did not have a mixer so we mixed by hand but it was very very mixed up!

Could anyone please help us please! we want these cookies to be great!! We are guessing the flour... but if we try again with the exact right flour should these be better? Any other tips or tricks to watch out for when making these?

PS - what the hell is the correct conversion of flour from 11.5 ounces in volume?

**Method: Chocolate Chip Cookies**

1. **Start by browning 2 sticks of unsalted butter. Once brown, place in a measuring cup and refrigerate for 1 hour or until it’s re-solidified.**
2. **In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the butter along with ½ cup of white sugar and 1 ½ cups of brown sugar. Mix well to combine.**
3. **Next add 2 cold eggs to the mixture, and mix to combine.**
4. **In a separate medium bowl, whisk together 11 ½ ounces of all purpose flour, 1 Tbsp of kosher salt, ½ tsp of baking soda, and ¾ tsp of cinnamon.**
5. **Add half of dry ingredients to the stand mixer, mix to combine, and then add the other half of the dry ingredients. This helps keep your gluten down.**
6. **Add your chocolate chips, stir just until everything is well combined and remove dough from mixer. Place in a bowl and refrigerate for at least an hour or as long as 2 days.**
7. **Optional: You can toast some nuts and add those to your cookie dough as well.**
8. **Roll your cookie dough into balls and then break in half and set on cookie sheet. This will help give the cookies a rustic look. Bake in a 350°F oven for 12-17 minutes or until they’ve reached your preferred doneness. Top with a little bit of sea salt.**

,AskBaking,"Banana Bread Muffins* to clarify, typo'd the title.

-------------------
I really like America's Test Kitchen blueberry jam swirl muffins, and I'm making banana bread for the first time and wanted to add a dark chocolate swirl the same way: add a small dollop to the top of the muffin and simply swirl it around a couple times with a chopstick to incorporate.  In the blueberry muffins, the jam incorporates well and adds a lot of flavor, without being noticeably distinct from the muffin, like an actual filling (such as in jelly doughnuts). 

What type of chocolate would be best this way? Does it matter? For example I don't know if just simply melted chocolate chips, or something like chocolate ganache, would be best. I would prefer a soft almost fudge-like addition instead of a chocolate that solidifies or stays runny. But I hardly ever do anything with chocolate more than using chocolate chips in cookies so I don't really know how to achieve that. I was also planning to add walnut pieces to the batter, and am using ATK's Ultimate Banana Bread [recipe](https://fortheloveofcooking.net/2017/01/ultimate-banana-bread.html) (non-paywall version), if it makes a difference.

Same goes for muffins, I found that muffins required more time but it then risked the bottom which was already completely baked.

,AskBaking,"Hey Y'all!

I'm pretty new to baking (a few basic white loaves and dinner rolls under my belt), and I'm trying to start branching out with King Arthur's Hokkaido Milk Bread [Recipe](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/japanese-milk-bread-rolls-recipe)

I have made 3 attempts at it with all of them ending(beginning?) in the exact same way. The dough is thick, wet, and will not rise more than 10% after extended proofing and rising in a 73F-76F kitchen. My dough never turns into a strong, elastic, smooth ball. Heads up, I'm hand mixing and hand kneading. 

All of my ingredient amounts follow the recipe exactly, but here are differences in method:

**1st Attempt (lazy attempt):**  
-Made thick roux, put in last at room temperature.  
-put in instant yeast and salt at same time.  
-Put in cold milk a little early before beating egg and melting butter.  
-put in butter a little hot.  
-Mixed for 2-4 minutes; dough was a little spotty  
-kneaded for 3-5 minutes  
Result: throw out after proof  

**2nd Attempt:**  
-Made medium-thick roux, put in last at room temperature  
-mixed all liquids together and then put in when slightly warm  
-salt and instant yeast placed on opposite sides of the bowl  
-Mixed for 4-6 minutes; dough was consistent color throughout  
-kneaded for 10-15 minutes  
-Result: Cooked as dinner rolls. Thick and dense insides  

**3rd Attempt:**  
-Made medium-thick roux, put in last at room temperature  
-mixed all liquids together and then put in when slightly warm  
-salt and active yeast (4 tsp) placed on opposite sides of the bowl  
-Mixed for 4-6 minutes; dough was consistent color throughout

,AskBaking,"Hi everyone! After years of casual hand-mixing, I recently bought a KA Artisan Mini 3.5-qt tilt-head mixer.

The mixer itself works great, but there's something that's driving my OCD side insane: The attachments each reach significantly **different depths** in the bowl. The whisk is the only one that's perfect (barely clears the bottom); the **flex edge beater is quite short** by comparison, and the dough hook even more so.

Since I often bake for just myself in **small batches** (hence my choice of the 3.5-qt Mini), the short reach of the beater and hook results in **poor to no mixing at the bottom** of the bowl. I imagine this would be a non-issue with larger batches, since the attachments would get a good hold of the bulk of the dough, and the dough itself would pick up the rest.

Now, the manual says that if the attachments aren't at the ideal barely-clearing-the-bottom height, you should **adjust the head height**. I did, but this created two new problems:

1. When you turn the set screw clockwise to lower the head, you also create a gap between the head and the locking arm. **The more you lower the head**, the less the lock can hold it down, and **the more the head wobbles**.
2. Because the attachments are inconsistent in height, if I lower the head to make the beater perfect (which to me is the most critical), the whisk bottoms out.

Problem #1 is a deal breaker, since I can't have a wobbly head. I hate that the height adjustment has a direct effect on the locking mechanism, and that I **can't lower the head without also loosening the lock**. From the factory setting, the only true height adjustment one can make is upward, not downward, without ending up with a wobbly head.

It's a shame because, with the head slightly lowered, the beater works 100% perfectly for my needs: Not only does it mix all the way to the bottom, but the flex edge also better matches the curvature of the bowl, scraping the sides much better than at the factory height setting.

Short of making larger batches or going back to hand-mixing, is there either a hack you guys can recommend, or another brand of mixer whose attachments all reach the same depth or whose head can be lowered while staying tightly locked?",t2_q2xvd,False,,0,False,KitchenAid mixer: Short attachments vs. small batches,[],r/AskBaking,False,,,0,,False,t3_de6jti,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Equipment,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1570412735.0,text,,,,text,self.AskBaking,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!

&lt;p&gt;I found some bread recipes but they have all mentioned a stoneware baker, is this needed? If so any recommendations on affordable good quality ones? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;#39;t have (and can&amp;#39;t afford) a kitchen aid, I have cheap hand beaters. Are the dough hand whisks worth the money? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other tools I should pick up? Affordable recommendations? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A family member has been wanting homemade bread so I&amp;#39;m taking these freebies as a sign, haha, but I really have no clue about what is and isn&amp;#39;t a necessity to make bread easier and worthwhile. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,AskBaking,"So ive been doing *a lot* of research into all of the different ""cake decoration"" products, im fairly new to cake decorating, and when to use which one vs another (fondsnt, mmf, gumpaste, etc) im currently making a cake where i need to make a fishing net and was looking into dfferent ways to make a Flexible icing to use i stead of royal icing to make the actual net. 

There were 2 main recipes i could find 1) was a mixture of Tylose powder, piping gel, con. Sugar, cornstarch, and powdered eggwhites. This is the one i actually will probably end up trying i just dont have ant tylose/xanthum or piping gel on hand... Which leads me to the other recipe amd my question. 2) powdered gumpaste mixed eith hot water and then beat with mixer until piping consistency. This one seems pretty straight forward and a lot less steps... However i dont have any powdered gumpaste available. I do have premade Wilton gmp aste though.

Now my question lol has anyome ever tried either of these recipes? I'm wondering if there is any difference other than added water between dry mix and premade gumpaste- ingredient wise they should be the same? Im wondering of i could add water to the premade mix the same as thw dry mix and get a similar end result.

They are very sticky and delicious, so I am hoping for ideas on how to make them look as good as they taste! I'm thinking on that one at least I should have layered more apples, it was mostly a flavor/timing test.

,AskBaking,"Hi all,

I felt like making Chris Morocco's cookie recipe after seeing people say great things about them. However, once I made them, the cookies tasted way too salty. Sometimes when I would take a bite, I would bite into a small salt chunk. I eventually realized that I used coarse salt that wasn't kosher, but rather meant for pickling/canning. But my question is, even though I used pickling coarse salt, why did the salt still not dissolve? And are the properties of pickling salt vs kosher salt that different? Just surprised that the cookies could taste that salty, as I only added 4g, which is what the recipe recommended. Thanks.

,AskBaking,"Hi everyone. I moved to a new apartment and am getting used to an electric oven instead of a gas one, and there is a steep learning curve, I am finding. 

I am trying to bake brownies with this recipe: https://www.goodlifeeats.com/recipe-exchange-simplest-homemade-brownies/

The first time I baked it, I baked on the lower side of the recipe for 25 minutes, then wrapped the top of the brownies in foil and put back in for five minutes. The issue was the top was well baked and actually ptobably overbaked, but the bottom was still underdone/undercooked. They dried out pretty easily and were much too cakey for my liking. I thought that maybe I didn't wait for them to cool enough, only two hours, and so I resovled to wait longer the next time.

The second time I just finished putting them in for 30 minutes, they looked perfect, and let them cool overnight, but I did wrap the top in tin foil before I went to bed. This morning they were looking great, but they were still kind of wet underneath and the ones in the middle were defintely undercooked on the bottom.

Any advice for this issue where they are baked/dried out on top but still underdone on the bottom with an electric oven? Should I have not wrapped them in tin foil overnight, this didn't allow enough moisture to escape the brownies with them wrapped up? Should the next time I try baking them take them out at a different time and then try wrapping them in tin foil?

I'd try wrapping them in tin foil from the beginning but I tried that with cornbread and it didn't cook right at all..

Things to note: oven rack is set lower to the bottom of the oven close to a heating grill and not close to the top, where there is another heating grill. I am following the recipe exactly, and I do want fudgey brownies but there is a line between fudgy and the bottoms still having some dampness to them and not being fully cooked in the middle.

I thought I should give an update because many people were asking the same questions and also I've since realized my original post did not explain everything clearly. Big disclaimer, I mentioned in the first post that I'd moved to another city before I started failing at making swiss meringue, but that's actually not true because my first batch after moving was successful. 

So, during the first week of August, I made a nice batch of swiss meriengue buttercream (strawberry flavored), it was perfect, did not have ANY PROBLEMS.

Then 2 weeks later, I tried to make another batch of the exact same buttercream, with the exact same method. And FAILED.I dissolved 2:1 sugar and egg whites over a bain marie and then whipped the mixture till cold, then added the butter. 
This is the first instance where the egg whites and sugar mixture did not whip to stiff peaks no matter how long I mixed for. So I just added the butter anyway and ended up with the most liquidy buttercream I've ever made.

2 weeks after my first defeat I decided to try again. But again, the egg white and sugar mixture did not stiffen, it looked glossy like a meringue but stayed a liquid. I retried 4 times before I decided to make this post, the fixes I attempted were:
-After whipping mixture till room temp, put in fridge until cold to continue whipping
-Add more sugar to try and stiffen mixture
-Wipe everything down with vinegar &amp; refrigerate b4 using

I did not add butter to any of the 4 tries because I knew I'd just waste my butter making the world's liquidiest buttercream.
One of the comments in the original post mentioned that plastic holds fats and therefore you cannot use plastic equipment for swiss meringue buttercream. So I went and bought a stainless steel bowl to replace my plastic mixing bowl (which I've been using for the last 5 batches).
And I still failed.

At this point I think I'm more disappointed at myself than my father is and I don't know what else to try anymore. I ended up making american buttercream for my cake but it's just too sweet. 

So if anyone has any good advice, please do let me know. It is baffling how there was only 2 weeks between my last successful batch of buttercream &amp; my first failure.

I am using a hand-held mixer because I'm a broke student and it works since I'm only making small batches.

&lt;p&gt;I am using a hand-held mixer because I&amp;#39;m a broke student and it works since I&amp;#39;m only making small batches. And I&amp;#39;ve been making swiss meringue buttercream religiously for 5 years and never experienced anything like this.&lt;/p&gt;

2 sticks vegan butter

400g brown sugar

1 tbsp vinegar

1 tbsp vanilla extract

Is there something similair to a textbook based on doughnuts? I feel it would be really helpful.

7 hour whole wheat autolyse, 4 stretch and folds every half our after that. Proofed another roughly 4 hours. Shaped and added to proofing basket another roughly one hour. Took out of basket, let rest roughly 15 minutes, then added to cast iron dutch oven.

- Refrigerating or freezing the dough for an additional 10 minutes prior to baking, after rolling the balls of dough. 
- Adding in an extra 1/4C Flour + 1/2tsp baking soda (per comments). 
- Rolling the cookies taller than they are wide.

,AskBaking,"Hi all. This is a lil embarrassing. I used to be a cake decorator, but it was for a grocery store bakery, so our cake layers were shipped to us already baked.

My boyfriend asked for a funfetti cake this year for his birthday. I was going to make a box cake like I've done at home (believe the brand for funfetti is Pillsbury?) and make homemade icing as usual, but heck. My boyfriend deserves a homemade cake!! So I'm going to make a funfetti cake from scratch. 

Was planning on using this recipe: https://preppykitchen.com/funfetti-cake-2/

My main question is... I was going to make the cake (recipe recommends you should do double recipe for an 8 inch round pan so thats what I'm doing) and I was going to split the cake into 3 layers. I'm probably overthinking this. I know that I can split the batter perfectly by weighing it into 3rds. But I only have one pan. Its a Fat Daddio 8-inch round (3 inch deep) pan.

So should I split up the batter and just bake each layer one at a time? I am worried about the batter getting too warm sitting on the counter or too cold sitting in the fridge.

EDIT: you've all left some wonderful suggestions and I'll be considering all of them!! Thank you so much!!

Okay, so everytime I bake cookies, doesn't seem to matter what recipe I use or how the pictures in the recipe looked, they all turn out fluffy and more cake/biscuit like.

I've tried to make them myself several times based on recipes online, but they always just end up soft like a regular cookie, or like chewy rocks. The best translation for them is ""sweet sesame ka'ak cookie"" and the ingredient list on the bag is: flour, yeast, butter, sugar, sesame, and vanilla.

For my next attempt I was thinking of adding semolina flour to get the crunch down(although it's not on the bag's ingredient list), I'll paste the recipe below.  I will also paste the recipe that resulted in chewy rocks for reference. What do you guys think? Thanks in advance for your help!

My hopeful next attempt: 

* ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk, divided (the 2 Tbsp of milk is for brushing the kaak before baking)
* ½ tsp vanilla
* 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
* ¼ cup semolina flour
* pinch kosher salt
* 2 teaspoons yeast
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* ½ cup (4 oz.) unsalted butter, softened to cool room  temperature
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* Toasted sesame seeds for the tops

   

1. Line a sheet pan with parchment or a Silpat.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, salt, yeast, baking powder. Set aside.
3. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,  or a hand mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 5  minutes. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in two  additions. Add the ¼ cup milk and combine until a soft, pliable dough  forms. The dough should not be sticky.
4. Shape the dough with your hands into rings, using about  2 tablespoons of dough per cookie (makes about 15 cookies). Gently move  the cookies to the baking sheet.
5. Brush the tops of each cookie with the 2 Tbsp of milk  and dip in sesame seeds.
6. Let the shaped unbaked cookie dough rest for four hours  uncovered.
7. Adjust the rack to the center of the oven and heat the  oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the cookies until they are golden brown, about  18 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool the cookies completely on a wire  rack. Keep the cookies in an airtight container for up to two weeks.

This recipe gave me chewy rocks:

Ingredients: 

&amp;#x200B;

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
* 1/3 cup of olive oil 
* 2/3 cup white sugar
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 
* 1 cup of toasted sesame seeds      
* Water to combine

Directions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Place the flour in a food  processor (or mixer); process a few seconds. Add the and baking soda; process to mix.
2. Add the vanilla extract and olive  oil through the feed tube; process a minute or so until the oil is no  longer visible and the dough is sandy in texture; add the brown sugar  through the feed tube and process until the dough leaves the sides of the  bowl and clumps, a couple or so minutes more. 
3. Gather the dough: It should  be moist, firm and compact. Pinch off small pieces and form into a small   sausage shape, rolling it back and forth till it reaches 4 inches in length. Bring the two ends together to form a ring. Dip the ring in the   sesame seeds. Place the cookies in a baking sheet lined with paper or  silicon mat. Bake for 15 minutes at 325F or until the cookies feel dry.  They will be extra-crispy as they cool. Store in a tight container for up      to 7 days.

,AskBaking,"Hi everybody!
I have been thinking of trying to make puff pastry for a while, but I have some doubts about the process.

1. Type of flour
My first question is about the flour used in the détrempe. 
Some recipes suggest a strong flour, some a mix of 00 flour and manitoba and other a weak flour.
I found different opinions and reasons about the use of each flour, so I'm quite lost.

2. Butter in the détrempe and flour in the butter
I knew the détrempe was made with just cold water, flour and salt, but some recipes add melted butter into it.
Do I have to add butter to the détrempe or not?
And finally, do I need to add flour to room temperature butter before putting it in the détrempe?

I know these are a lot of questions, but I'm quite intimidated eheh.

,AskBaking,"Hi all,

I am making a peach pie, and my recipe calls for lemon juice, which I don't have - the poster claims it is necessary to retain the cell walls of the peaches so they don't break down into mush during baking. I saw a recommendation for substitution in apple pie using half apple cider vinegar half water to keep the apples from going brown - which is kind of a non-issue for me. I just care about the flavour. I am wondering three things:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Can I use half apple cider vinegar and half water as a substitute, and strain the peaches so I retain less of the vinegar flavour?
2. Is there a different substitution you would recommend?
3. In your opinion, is this even necessary in a peach pie? can I just omit the lemon juice?

,AskBaking,"I posted a while back that I was having trouble with my doughs not coming together /clearing the sides of the bowl in my mixer. The suggestion was to get my mixer calibrated, which I did, but I didn't really do any baking over the summer because it heats up the house too much. Fast forward to today... and the problem isn't fixed. 

I measured my flour to the precise tenth of an ounce, carefully measured my wet ingredients, etc. The dough was supposed to go on med-low speed until it cleared the bowl (appx 8 minutes, so said the recipe), then knead by hand for about 30 seconds until it formed a ball.

After 8 minutes, it was practically a batter. I added about 1/4 cup of flour and let it go for another two minutes. That didn't really help matters, so I decided to go to hand kneading. After several minutes and at least another 1/4 cup flour, it was no closer to forming a ball.

I did double the recipe, but it was a really small one to begin with. The doubled recipe called for 20 oz flour, 1 cup water, 2 egg yolks, and 2/3 cup yogurt.

,AskBaking,"Hello, new baker here. I was recommended to bake bread out of Flour Water Salt Yeast, I got all of the stuff and ingredients and it worked very well. Basically the recipe I want to use has me do this

1. combine flour and water, mix, rest for 30min
2. mix in salt and yeast, then let the dough rise for like 5 hours
3. fold it a few times while it is rising
4. divide it, shape it into bread, put the balls into a proofing basket for 1.25 hours
5. bake it

So I'm seeing in a lot of recipes for this (the ground meat it chorizo by the way) to flatten the dough, and then roll the cooked meat into it. When would I do this, before the proofing? also how can I proof it into a shape other than a big massive ball?

I also was baking the bread in a dutch oven. Should I still do this for the recipe? The last bread had a really hard crust, which was nice, but made it very hard to cut which would potentially be a problem if it's stuffed with meat.

,AskBaking,"I'll try to be as detailed as possible since i know a lot can go wrong with the egg based buttercreams. I attempted making the Alton Brown french buttercream recipe today (1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup dark corn syrup ((I subbed with a 3/1 ratio of light corn syrup and molasses)) 3 large eggs, and 10 oz butter)

I made sure to really get my sugar/syrup mixture to a good rolling boil and my eggs quite foamy before I slowly poured the mixture in using a greased measuring cup. I did not check the temperature at any point, but i did let the mixture come to a rolling boil with large bubbles. I did notice the mixture starting to thicken toward the end of my adding it to the eggs, but by then it was too late and the mix looked ok. 

As soon as the outsides of my metal mixing bowl had completely cooled to touch (room temperature) I started slowly adding butter. All the air was knocked out of the mix by my second piece of butter, so I stopped what i was doing and put the remaining butter in the friends for a few minutes. I then continued everything until the end product was a smooth, if soft buttercream. I stored it in the fridge and made my cakes. there were some sugar syrup remnants in the base of my bowl.

Just now, after letting my cakes cool an extra long time to be doubly sure they were cool, I went to re beat my frosting (straight from the fridge) and it immediately curdled.

It wasn't the temp of the cakes, even the frosting in my bowl turned to soup. The total time it spent outside the fridge was easily under 10 minutes.

,AskBaking,"I see a lot of half dome ideas on google/pinterest but they are individual sized and not so much a table centerpiece. I assume the best way to go is to use a silicone mold with a no-bake recipe, freeze it, then glaze but will it all stay together come serving time? Also I wonder if it would be possible to stack them using a dowel like a fancy wedding cake display. The person specifically requested a non bread-like cake, but a cheesecake and I also assume a mousse cake will be acceptable. But all this is assuming there is enough structural integrity for everything to stay together. Perhaps gelatin is the answer? Largest [hemi-spherical silicone mold](https://www.pastrychef.com/TORTAFLEX-HEMISPHERE-MOLDS_p_2378.html)I've found online is 7 1/16"" diameter (180mm) which holds a volume of 1570ml or 6 2/3 cups.

The person specifically requested a non bread-like cake, but a cheesecake and I also assume a mousse cake will be acceptable.

1. Preheat oven to 350F and grease two 9-inch round pans

2. Cream 1/2 cup (96g) shortening with and 1 1/2 (300g) cup sugar

3. Add 2 eggs and beat well

4. Add 2 tablespoons cocoa powder and 2 teaspoons gel red food coloring to mixture

5. Mix 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 1 cup buttermilk in a bowl

6. Add 2 1/2 cups (192g) flour to mixture, alternating with the buttermilk mixture, mixing only until just incorporated

7. Mix 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda and 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar, then gently fold into mixture (get cake into oven as fast as possible)

8. Pour batter into prepared pans and bake for 30 minutes, until inserted tester comes out clean

Icing:

1. Beat 450g cream cheese and 115g unsalted butter until smooth

2. Add 540g confectioner's sugar, 1 tablespoon heavy cream

4. Add more confectioner's sugar if frosting is too thin, more cream if frosting is too thick, or more salt if frosting is too sweet

I have tried making the above recipe twice so far. At first I thought the leavening method in step 7 was a bit strange, but I tried it anyway. The cake didn't rise at all, and came out of the oven very deflated. I liked the flavor though, so I tried making it again. In the second iteration, I tried adding the baking soda with the flour, and still adding the vinegar at the end. It didn't deflate per se, but it didn't rise to form a dome shape like I expected it to. What can I do to adjust this? Do I have to change the timing of the baking soda and vinegar? Will switching out the ap flour with cake flour have a positive effect?

,AskBaking,"As an amateur home baker, I’ve found most recipes give specific rollout size instructions, such as for croissants. I’ve had good luck with making laminated dough (and croissants using Weekend Bakery’s recipe), but I would like to use the dough for other viennoiseries as well. Are there any general guidelines as to what size/thickness to roll out laminated dough to in order to make various pastries - croissants, pain aux raisins, danish, etc - that might scale from small batch and up?

For example, the Weekend Bakery croissant recipe has a laminated block (after three turns) about 22x14cm, and directs it to be rolled out to 20 x 100cm for croissant cutting. A different pain aux raisin recipe I have used says to roll out to 60x33cm and then roll it up to create a 51cm log, cutting x20 2.5cm portions. It’s a bit difficult to reconcile the differences between the various recipes, so any general guidelines would be great, especially in relation to thickness (recipes never seem to give that). Ultimately, it would be great to have enough understanding of any general guidelines here to be able to split the dough, and roll half out for croissants and half for pain aux raisins or danish.

Slightly off-topic additional questions:

Does anyone have any experience using a baking steel in the oven with viennoiseries? Either to just conduct heat at the bottom or to actually bake on (either directly or on a baking sheet placed directly on the steel)? I’m not sure if this would improve the bake/oven spring in a home oven by intensifying the bottom heat, or just make things worse?

So I tried making honey crullers following the above recipe but they smelt very heavily of eggs and I couldn't bear to eat them. 

Based on this recipe and others, I realized the crullers are just fried choux pastry. The instructions on making the choux pastry weren't the best but I just followed the typical procedure for choux, making sure to add the flour quickly, drying it out as much as I could and then adding in eggs one at a time and letting the dough sort of come together before adding the next egg. The only mistake I made here is I added in 2 eggs at once at the beggining. I don't think that could have caused the stink though, it just took forever for the dough to come together.

I did leave the choux sitting on the counter for like 15-20 minutes while I was having my dinner, and then refigerated it for another half hour before piping it and frying it in the oil which was around 370 F.

I was considering using coarsely chopped macadamia nuts or pecans.
* For the ""purple stuff"" in the middle, I'm torn between some kind of blueberry mousse/gelatin, or a stiffened blueberry cream cheese frosting. 
* For the topping, I was going to attempt a salted caramel sauce whipped into a caramel buttercream and then pipe it on.
* For the horns, I won't have time for a meringue or molded chocolate that takes more than 4-6 hours to set. So to lighten up the cake flavors I was going to make lemon poppy seed shortbread cookies shaped into horns and frosted/colored with whatever I use for the middle.
* Do you think all these flavors and textures will work together? Rich chocolate sponge, creamy or fluffy blueberry, creamy caramel and lemon poppy seed?

&lt;li&gt;For the chocolate sponge I plan on using &lt;a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/02/bravetarts-devils-food-cake.html""&gt;BraveTart&amp;#39;s Devil Food Cake&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Cacao-Barry-Cocoa-Powder-Extra/dp/B00BLTNL4Q/ref=sr_1_3?crid=25N06GIBWGNTU&amp;amp;keywords=cacao+barry+cocoa+powder+100%25+cocoa+extra+brute&amp;amp;qid=1565834548&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sprefix=cacao+barry+cocoa+pow%2Caps%2C158&amp;amp;sr=8-3""&gt;fancy European cacao.&lt;/a&gt; But for the brown little mix-ins, it looks like &lt;a href=""/u/shaolinblaze""&gt;u/shaolinblaze&lt;/a&gt; used butterscotch chips. I was considering using coarsely chopped macadamia nuts or pecans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &amp;quot;purple stuff&amp;quot; in the middle, I&amp;#39;m torn between some kind of blueberry mousse/gelatin, or a stiffened blueberry cream cheese frosting. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the topping, I was going to attempt a salted caramel sauce whipped into a caramel buttercream and then pipe it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the horns, I won&amp;#39;t have time for a meringue or molded chocolate that takes more than 4-6 hours to set. So to lighten up the cake flavors I was going to make lemon poppy seed shortbread cookies shaped into horns and frosted/colored with whatever I use for the middle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you think all these flavors and textures will work together? Rich chocolate sponge, creamy or fluffy blueberry, creamy caramel and lemon poppy seed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an ambitious, amateur baker: I appreciate your time and welcome your advice!&lt;/p&gt;

Been going crazy the past few months trying to find a high quality flan baking dish that meets the following for my dad who has a really specific recipe/method for making it:

\- Min 12"" diameter circle, 1/2"" to 3/4"" in depth

\- No fluting along the inside or outside edge of the dish

\- ceramic

\- sides that are vertical, little to no angle

\- oven safe

Ideally it would be something that can be used for years to come. I've scoured Williams Sonoma, Sur La Tab, LeCrueset, Amazon. Closest I could find were cake and quiche baking dishes, but none of them quite hit all my requirements. Wondering if anyone has any other ideas I can take a look at.

&lt;p&gt;however, everything was cookes, we used the knife in middle testing. We (my brother and i) are just a bit stumped why it burt around the edges and rised in the middle like it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left the cake to cook for 20 minutes (like advised to do) and it&amp;#39;s currently colling off before we ad some cream on top&lt;/p&gt;

,AskBaking,"Hello!

I am a very amateur baker and I am planning on making a chocolate cake for my anniversary. I am struggling to find a recipe that I like. I am going for a two layer chocolate cake with strawberry filling in between the layers and chocolate frosting. Right now I am between two very similar recipes with a few differences. The first recipe includes bittersweet chocolate, which I use recently to make fudge and I really enjoyed how that came out, flavor-wise. A few of the reviews of this recipe say the cake came out very dry and stuck to the pan. The other recipe only has cocoa powder, and I’m afraid it will not have a strong enough chocolate flavor for what I am going for. The second recipe is much more highly reviewed and popular. I really want this cake to be great so I am wary to try either. If someone with more baking experience and talent could recommend one over the other, a mix of the two, or another recipe that would fit my goal I would appreciate it. 

Recipe one:
½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan

2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for pan

6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped

1 cup brewed coffee

⅔ cup unsweetened cocoa powder (not  Dutch process)

My first try, they came out absolutely perfect, super chewy, and not hollow in the least - &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/albOmuO""&gt;a photo of my triumph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the month since that perfect batch, I&amp;#39;ve made literally dozens of attempts, each of them turning out entirely hollow. I know hollows are a common pitfall with French-style macarons, but my understanding is that the extra work of making them Italian-style should pay dividends with reliably chewy cookies. Has anyone else encountered hollow Italian-style macarons? Thanks so much!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not a professional, by any means, but I have been baking for over 15 years and made a couple wedding cakes and plan on making my own wedding cake next years too. I bake sourdough successfully and lots of other things! It’s my jam! I bake to relax! So! I’ve been commissioned to make a chocolate birthday cake. Easy peasy. Traditional chocolate cake. Whipped caramel ganache filling. Chocolate Swiss meringue buttercream. A chocolate drizzle and some crunchy coffee cocoa bits for texture. Planning two or three layers. No problem. 

I decide to try a new cake recipe (I know. My first mistake) because I was intrigued and, come on... I can make this work. But I can’t. I made the recipe first time. Underbaked. SO underbaked. I thought. I used a skewer to test. It was springing back in the center when i touched it. It was past the time thenrecipe said. Let layers cool. Decide to trim the top a bit (to get a taste 😂) gummy. Seemed not baked. Soooo dense. Ew. Ok. Try again. So I halved the recipe and tried just baking one layer. It SEEMED to come out ok. I left it in for almost 10 minutes longer than the last one. Still showed all the signs of being done. Let it cool. Sliced the top. It seemed better. So I decided to bake two more layers, but one at a time. They cooled and i was skeptical because they just were slumping and looked kinda weird so, in still being able to use them if they were good, I trim it a little to get a taste. They. Were. Awful. Same gummy seemed underbaked, but how?! They were in so long. I followed the recipe. I’m familiar with my oven and know it’s temp. What the heck is wrong with me or what is up with this weird recipe that clearly looks delicious?! I’ve now got five layers of cake in my trash (my husband spit out a piece of cake I offered. Spit it out. My husband. It was bad, you guys.) and no layers of cake for my commissioned birthday cake 

Almost gonna buy some box mixes out of frustration. Husband and mother (who I texted on the other side of the country for comfort) both convinced me to just make a normal Cale recipe I’m familiar with.

The thing is, it works, but not to the degree I'm looking for. I'm trying to make edible cookie dough that is still more on the creamier side after being refrigerated. So far the dough gets a bit hard and hard to scoop (think like ice cream!). The consistency relaxes a little after physically handling but I can't serve it by doing that first.

I never really baked before moving into this apartment and the fridge is brand new so it's completely possible it's running too cold and making my dough too hard. I have no experience in how cookie dough is supposed to behave usually.

,AskBaking,"I recently made these [cookies](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/11246-vegan-chocolate-chip-cookies). It called for 2 cups of all purpose flour. 
I know 1 cup of flour is 120g, so I measured for 2 cups, or 240g of flour. 
The [dough was on the wetter/oily side](https://imgur.com/a/JHBapFN), but I figured it's a vegan recipe so might be different from non-vegan cookie dough. [Cookies were a bit on the oily side](https://imgur.com/a/JHBapFN), not exactly what it looks like in the picture, regardless tasted great. 

I look at the recipe again, and notice that it calls for 2 cups *(10 ounces)* of ap flour. 

But

1 cup = 4.25oz 

2 cups = 8.25oz

8.25 =/= 10oz

I'd say the cookies could've used the extra 1.75oz.

Why is there this discrepancy? 

But most of all, it got me thinking how off you can be with measuring despite measuring ""correctly"". Who knows how recipe blogs or old recipe books measured their flours, etc.. You'll never know the *exact* recipe of anything.

,AskBaking,"My bread often comes out nice and tasty, but I keep having problems when it comes to the shaping stage. My usual routine is to mix the ingredients for the dough together loosely, leave it for half and hour, and then mix it with a dough hook on a hand-mixer for around eight minutes or so. I then take it out of the bowl, oil it, put it back in and leave it to rise overnight in the fridge. I then bake it in the morning by taking it out (I've tried taking it out and leaving it for an hour to get back up to room temperature too), knocking the air out by folding the dough in on itself and then trying to shape it before going in the oven.

I can get an okay sort of boule shape, but whenever I try to follow my recipe book's guide on shaping I just can't get the dough to behave itself. It says I need to shape it into a rough rectangle, before folding the two sides into the middle and rolling it up. The problem is is that I can barely stretch the dough at all because it just springs back, and if I use too much force it simply tears. It just feels like it doesn't want to change shape at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently looking for some protective arm sleeve for another baker.  They've already burnt their forearm from a hot tray in the past and I don't want to happen again as their workplace does not provide protective arm sleeves.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I've done some shopping and a tiny bit of research on the materials used for the products I found.   As of now, I've purchased a pair of [black kevlar protective arm sleeves](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B077YK66HN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) (linked for your convenience).

&amp;#x200B;

I found that the arm sleeves I bought performed as expected and they fit me just well, but I'm afraid that they're rather large for the person I'm buying them for.  I'm sure there will be other things that will cause some discomfort, such as increased heat and humidity from prolonged wear, and potential slipping.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here I am.  Wondering if there are any arm sleeves that may be more eye catching and more comfortable for prolonged wear.

I tried making a sandwich and it was absolutely horrible trying to keep it together.  Please help as this is the best tasting recipe I have found and although I've had other issues in the past, none this bad.  Recipe below.

Onion Rye Bread-

2 1/2 cup bread or all purpose flour (approx)

1 1/2 cup rye flour, stone ground preferred 

2 Tbsp sugar

2 tsp salt

1 package dry yeast

1 cup milk, room temp

1/2 cup hot water (120-130 degrees F)

2 Tbsp vegetable oil

3/4 cup finely chopped onion

2 Tbsp caraway seeds

1 egg beaten, mixed with 1 Tbsp cream and 2 tsp water

Process:

Mix 1 1/2 cup white flour with 1/2 cup rye flour, the sugar, salt, and yeast.  Make a well and pour in milk, water, and oil.  Mix to make a thick batter, add chopped onion and caraway seeds.  

Stir in the remaining 1 cup rye flour and add the remaining white flour 1/4 cup at a time to make a mass that can be lifted from the bowl.

Turn dough onto flour work surface and kneed aggressively for around 8-10 minutes.  Place in oiled bowl to double in size.  

Punch down, form ball and let rest 3-4 minutes.  Form to fit bread pan, then cover and let double in volume.

Brush top with egg-cream wash.

Bake @ 375F 30-40 minutes.  Turn out and test for doneness.  If needed, return to oven for 10 minutes out of pan.

Cool on wire racks.

I am in utah and she is getting married in idaho so I will have to transport things and since I dont have a lot of time I was planning to freeze the cake layers, cupcakes, icing and macarons and take them with me in a cooler to idaho. 

This week I practiced making everything. The macarons were great so no issues there but I had trouble with my cakes and icing. 

The cake layers and cupcakes are the same recipe https://bakingamoment.com/simply-perfect-chocolate-cake/

I have made the cake before and it was delicious and moist but after freezing it this time it was dry and crumbly. I cooled the layers and cupcakes completely before double wrapping them in saran wrap and then freezing them. A couple days later I put them in the cooler and took them to a different location where I left them in the fridge for about 24 hours to thaw. Then I took the cakes out, leveled them and put chocolate simple syrup on each layer as I frosted it. Then I crumb coated the cake and frosted it and left it out for about an hour before eating it. The cupcakes I didn't put any simple syrup on but they seemed just as dry. What did I do wrong? Did I leave them in the fridge too long? Is it possible to transport cakes like this? 

Secondly my frosting. I made a swiss meringue buttercream https://preppykitchen.com/how-to-make-swiss-buttercream/

This recipie has turned out great at home before and is pretty and white. But this time I froze it and then took it in the cooler and left it in the fridge for 20 hours. It was still pretty hard so I set it out on the countertop to thaw more. When I went to whip it up it wasn't quite room temperature though. My icing then turned out greasy and shiny looking and was more yellow than it was at home. Did I mess up by not waiting until it was completely room temperature? How do I fix it?

,AskBaking,"I made cream cheese strawberry turnovers tonight. The recipe I used had me mix the strawberries with cornstarch and sugar. I made sure when filling the pastry that I didn't over do it, I almost thought I wouldn't have enough filling till i made it through the whole bowl. The thing that gets me though is that the juice from the strawberries leaked out the air hole I cut in the tops. On some pastries it even came out the crimped sides. I can't for the life of me figure out why though, I used fresh strawberries. 
Do I need to cook out the excess water in the strawberries first to do this? 
I did cut the strawberries up at least 1 hour before mixing them with cornstarch and sugar and then put them back in the fridge if that makes a difference. I know it doesn't change the taste quality but I do want to at least get them looking well enough to present at parties and such.

The recipe I used had me mix the strawberries with cornstarch and sugar. I made sure when filling the pastry that I didn&amp;#39;t over do it, I almost thought I wouldn&amp;#39;t have enough filling till i made it through the whole bowl. The thing that gets me though is that the juice from the strawberries leaked out the air hole I cut in the tops. On some pastries it even came out the crimped sides. I can&amp;#39;t for the life of me figure out why though, I used fresh strawberries. 
Do I need to cook out the excess water in the strawberries first to do this? 
I did cut the strawberries up at least 1 hour before mixing them with cornstarch and sugar and then put them back in the fridge if that makes a difference. I know it doesn&amp;#39;t change the taste quality but I do want to at least get them looking well enough to present at parties and such. &lt;/p&gt;

,AskBaking,"I have been trying to nail down BA's best chocolate chip recipe [(LINK)](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-chocolate-chip-cookies).

The recipe calls for browning the butter, 1 ^(1/2)  Sticks (^(3/4) Cup)

The first time I made it I browned enough butter to have ^(3/4) cup of melted brown butter, which resulted in overly greasy buttery cookies. I did a little googling and found that browned butter should be about ^(3/4) of the original butter since the water has evaporated. So from this I assumed that browning 1 ^(1/2)  Sticks (^(3/4) Cup) butter should result in ^(1/2) cup of browned butter for the final recipe. 

Except when I went to brown my butter, I ended up with roughly the same measurement I started out with. I didn't want to end up having the same problem as before so I used about half a cup of the browned butter and the cookies tasted better than the first attempt. 

My question is how much butter am I supposed to be using for the recipe after browning, is it the full ^(3/4) of a cup - or the reduced amount of ^(1/2) cup? 

And second, why didn't my butter reduce in volume? Did i not cook it long enough for the water to evaporate - even though it had developed a nice amber colour and nutty aroma? I was scared of burning so I assumed it was done, should I have let it cook some more?

,AskBaking,"All my life until the past few years, I had an electric stove and oven which produced consistent results when baking. I made chocolate chip cookies (classic Toll House recipe) that always came out well, even though I measured using measuring cups.

Now that I'm living in another country, I don't have access to an electric oven. Most people here use gas stove and oven combos, which is what I have.

1) it takes much longer to preheat this oven than an electric oven

2) it doesn't seem to regulate temperature well, as once my thermometer indicates it's at the dial temp the temperature just keeps rising past it anyway.

,AskBaking,"Recently I decided to make a batch of carrot cake banana bread and was cramped for time, so I ended up with my bread being rather undercooked. I decided to give regular banana bread another shot today and made sure I had ample time to bake longer than the recipe called for. 

The recipe I made was [this one](https://thesaltymarshmallow.com/best-banana-bread-recipe/) with the following changes: 

- 75g White Sugar &amp; 125g Dark Brown Sugar (instead of 1C white sugar)
- 1 tsp cinnamon (instead of 1/2tsp)
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg (added)
- 65g Walnuts (added)
- 2 tbsp turbinado sugar (added to top)

The bread flavor is great! I've cut into it while it's still hot, so of course it's a bit crumbly, but it tastes great. There's just one problem...

The edges are just a *little* bitter! I wouldn't call them burnt, but the taste is slightly noticeable. It's just the sides and bottom of the bread; the top is fine and it is cooked through -- though it probably could have safely taken another 5 minutes just to fluff and dry it up a bit more.

I measured the temperature of my bread and pulled it when the internal temperature was around 195°F. This meant that I baked the bread for 60 minutes initially, then for another 15 minutes after that to reach the appropriate temperature. The total bake time was 75 minutes at 350°F on the center rack of my oven. I used a copper (coated?) 9x5 pan that I bought from Walmart.

&lt;p&gt;The edges are just a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bitter! I wouldn&amp;#39;t call them burnt, but the taste is slightly noticeable. It&amp;#39;s just the sides and bottom of the bread; the top is fine and it is cooked through -- though it probably could have safely taken another 5 minutes just to fluff and dry it up a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I measured the temperature of my bread and pulled it when the internal temperature was around 195°F. This meant that I baked the bread for 60 minutes initially, then for another 15 minutes after that to reach the appropriate temperature. The total bake time was 75 minutes at 350°F on the center rack of my oven. I used a copper (coated?) 9x5 pan that I bought from Walmart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the bread is quite dark as well. I would like to be able to bake a perfect, evenly colored bread. Any tips on what I could change next time?&lt;/p&gt;

Thank you all for your advice! I really appreciate it. 

I waited until my friend gave me some updates about the cupcakes (flavors, frosting types, when she'd have them ready) and I asked her what she was thinking in terms of price. She told me $25 which I had a feeling she'd go too low. I told her that I was thinking closer to $40 and she said that professionals get paid that much and she was not a professional.

I convinced her to go a little higher and we met at $30 but I told her that she shouldn't undersell herself because everything she makes turns out amazing. It was a really nice conversation, uplifting for both of us, and not awkward at all.

This is my second time baking a cheesecake using the same recipe and for some reason, the top of my cheesecake was getting brown really quick. I think it was about at 15 minutes when my boyfriend turned off the oven saying it was too hot and that's why it was browning. He's a chef so I trusted his judgement and left the cheesecake inside the oven for the remaining 15 minutes. After that, I continued following my recipe and took out the cheesecake and let it cool in the bain marie to room temperature. Thankfully, no cracks! But the top of my cheesecake is pretty brown.

Do you think my cheesecake is cooked all the way even though I didn't bake it for as long as the recipe called? I'm serving it today to my boyfriend's friends and I don't want to give them an uncooked cheesecake.

,AskBaking,"Hello everyone!

This isn’t necessarily baking but since I want to use the chocolates as decor, it might qualify as such. 

Thing is, I have failed a few attempts to make my own chocolates over the past days. I want them to be filled, so I started to melt some choc and coated the outsides of my silicon chocolate tray and let them cool. Then I applied the filling (a caramel sauce and some peanut cream) and coated it with chocolate to close it; once, I poured the chocolate right on the filling, the other time I let the filling cool down first. I waited the night and they are all stiff and firm, but I can’t get them out of the tray. Sometimes the outside chocolate layer is too thin and it breaks and other times the final chocolate layer just peels of and the rest is still stuck in the tray. From four attempts, I got like 8 okayish chocolates.

&lt;p&gt;Maybe if we use hardy tray liners? &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Hestya-Pieces-Muffin-Cupcake-Natural/dp/B07DRBCL94/ref=sxbs_sxwds-stvp?keywords=heavy+cupcake+liners&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B07DRBCL94&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=8c07bfd6-96c8-4610-ad24-79e4d54c047b&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=BXR74&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=0vNYR&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=a6d018ad-f20b-46c9-8920-433972c7d9b7&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=5EN55YMKRYNFKNT1TE04&amp;amp;qid=1559444980&amp;amp;s=home-garden""&gt;Maybe like these&lt;/a&gt;?  &lt;/p&gt;

,AskBaking,"Hi, 
The following is my Grandpa’s sweet bread recipe. The ingredient amounts listed are approximates, as he made everything by feel. (I’m guessing that some of these amounts may be incorrect.) I’ve tried making this recipe multiple times; the finished product tastes like his bread (in terms of sugar), but the texture of the bread is always too dense. Could this be due to incorrect recipe ratios? Recipe methods? Am I handling the dough incorrectly? Any thoughts about how to lighten the texture would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Grandpa’s Sweet Bread

Yield: 2 loaves

Ingredients 

Bread:

* 3 cups Gold Medal All-Purpose flour, divided
* 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 egg, beaten
* 3 tablespoons Crisco
* 1 teaspoon salt
* olive oil
* egg wash

Yeast mixture:

* 1/4 cup water
* 2 1/4 teaspoons Fleischmann’s Active Dry yeast
* 1 teaspoon sugar

Directions 

* Make a well out of 1.5 C. flour. Add the following: 1/2 C. + 2 tblsp. sugar, egg, and Crisco. Pour salt on top of the well.
* Make a second well out of the remaining 1.5 C. flour.
* Heat water to 105 degrees F. Dissolve 1 packet of yeast into the warm water and then stir in 1 tsp. sugar. Let mixture proof for 10 mins.
* Add yeast mixture to second well.
* Mix contents of both wells together. Add additional warm water, if necessary.
* Knead dough until smooth. (Instead, I’ve been using a dough hook/electric mixer for this step; I can never get dough to clear sides of bowl; instead, I use widowpane test. I needed additional 3 tablespoons of flour to achieve windowpane.)
* Rub top of dough with olive oil and then place in a metal bowl, also coated with olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap, and place bowl in a warm area for 45 mins., or until dough doubles in size. (Instead, I’ve been using a proofing box set to 75 degrees F, and let dough rest for 2 hours.)
* Punch down dough and knead for a few minutes. Let dough rise again for another 45 mins., or until it doubles in size. (Instead, I placed dough in proofing box and let rise for another hour.)
* Cut dough into 2 pieces.
* Divide each piece of dough into 3 pieces. Roll each piece into a long strip. Braid 3 strips together to make one loaf (this recipe yields 2 loaves).
* Place braids onto a cookie sheet covered with Silpat. Let braids sit for another 45 mins., or until they double in size. (Instead, I placed in proofing box for another 45 minutes.)
* Warm oven to 350 degrees F.
* Brush each braid with egg wash. Place cookie sheet onto top rack of oven. Cook for 20 mins. Check bread.

,AskBaking,"I hope this question is okay for the subreddit!

&amp;nbsp;

I was up late baking a cheesecake because I'm terrible at time management. I cleared off a shelf in the fridge and come morning,  it was apparent someone had dragged their fingers through it and scooped out a huge piece. I've narrowed it down to two people, neither of which fessing up, but that's beside the point. I made it for my family and not to serve at an event or anything, we're gross and don't care about whatever grime and grossness transferred ~~from some rude asshole's fingers~~ to the cake.

&amp;nbsp;

**Actual question if you want to skip the explanation above!!**
There's not really a proper repair for it, but do you have any suggestions for a filling I can put in the irregular gap? It's fairly big so preferably something firm-ish, but runny is okay.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for your responses! I went with the sour cream topping suggestion. I wanted to use fruit as well but we don't have anything suitable at the moment.

,AskBaking,"Hello, r/AskBaking!  I'm considering drastically shifting my career path towards the culinary arts by way of baking and I was hoping others on here would have some advice or personal stories on how to break into the field.  I'm in the US (SoCal) so there's no shortage of bakeries and markets in my area.  My current work is relatively flexible on hours as well.

Some questions:

* I've been told that if I don't want to go back to school for culinary, my best shot is to try ""staging"" (procnounced ""stahjing"" I'm told?) as an apprentice at a bakery for X months, likely in an unpaid internship status, to learn basic techniques the right way.  So is this setup usually only done at independent bakeries, or will modern grocery stores and restaurants know what I'm talking about if I inquire about staging there?
* OTOH, if you have experience doing culinary school in your late 20's or beyond I want to hear about that experience too, and if it was a correct choice for you.
* Without any culinary experience other than a coffee shop serving job and a bagel shop sandwich maker in college, is it appropriate to apply for entry level positions at bakeries and ALSO mention staging in the same cover letter for a paid job?  Or will hiring managers generally be scared away by employment law confusion etc.
* Is it still appropriate to go in in person FIRST to introduce myself to a head baker and inquire about staging in person out of the blue?  Or should I be sending a resume to the hiring managers.

A bit about me, I'm 30 y.o., who has worked in the non-profit sector for most of my 20's and became seriously disillusioned by the ""work to make a difference"" culture of long hours on ""an activist's salary,"" mentality of that entire sector.  I'm fine with a modest income, but not minimum wage at a 60+ hrs a week position.  As I came to dislike my work more and more, gardening and cooking (especially baking) became my main outlets for stress relief to the point where I'd make food just to give away to impress others.  I've come to suspect that making food could be the thing I always should have pursued professionally, and was always just too pre-occupied by family and educational stresses to seriously consider doing it for a paycheck.  I've taught myself many many of the basics from cookbooks and websites but have limited experience in foodservice jobs, all from 8+ years back.

,AskBaking,"i’m making my first wedding cake for my boyfriend’s best friends wedding, i have just under two weeks. it’s nothing incredibly fancy, a three tier carrot cake (6” for their frozen topper, 8” and a 10” bottom).

I'm hoping you guys might be able to help me troubleshoot a few issues with the recipe so I am better prepared next time! [This](https://domesticgothess.com/blog/2016/04/22/smores-eclairs/) is the recipe I used. As an aside, I did measure all of my ingredients by weight.

**Issues**

- My creme patissiere never came to a boil while cooking, but did get *incredibly* thick. Although it wasn't boiling, once it became thick I started the 'two minute' timer. It was so thick I struggled to mix it and had to recruit my boyfriend to do it. Straight out of the fridge, it was too thick to pipe. Even after microwaving, piping it was extremely difficult. Even at room temperature, it was more of a custard than a cream. **What made the pastry cream so thick?**

- I ultimately had to use 4.5 eggs to get my choux pastry to a texture even vaguely like what I had seen online in videos. It was still potentially a bit thick, but I was able to get a decently long ribbon out of it at that point and it held it's shape well (and was easy to pipe). **Is it correct to assume I had to use more eggs due to regional differences?**

- I overshot the size of my eclairs a bit and they were probably closer to 13cm than 12cm. However, during baking they really barely colored at all. I gave them an extra 5 minutes (35 minutes instead of 25-30) until they started to color, but they were only golden on top, around the craquelin. During cooling, I cracked the oven door (I saw many recipes online suggest this) and cooled them for around 25 minutes. While cooling, they completely collapsed. **What happened to make my eclairs collapse and/or how can I keep it from happening next time?** (Note: This was the biggest issue by far as it made my eclairs unusable.)

,AskBaking,"Hello! Anyone willing to help out a new-ish sourdough enthusiast? I’ve had my starter for almost two months and have been baking enthusiastically with it. I’ve enjoyed some good loaves and some not so good. To be expected. So, I’ve been trying to up my hydration! Just for giggles. I do enjoy the lower hydration loaves, the feel of the dough and taste and texture of the bakes, but I’d also like to challenge myself a bit with going higher. 

The loaves o made in the past that have been wetter I’ve obviously had trouble with spreading. I have done a lot of bakes from the perfect loaf website, so that’s where I’ve been getting a lot of my information. Up until today I would do the mixing, bulk ferment, and shape, then proof in the fridge overnight. I recently moved to south Texas and it has been hot and humid, so I felt like as I was trying to get the dough to rise in a warm spot (my garage) the dough would be too warm and I’d put it in the fridge and the next morning it would be over proofed from residual heat and I’d get the squatty loaves in the oven. Super bummer. My garage turns out.. is probably 85 degrees. I rose a loaf in my house today (around 75 degrees) and did bulk ferment and proof and bake all in one day. No fridge rest. After a 2 hour proof I did the poke test and I felt it maybe already overproofed! Again! Preheated oven, dumped out bread, watched it spread all over the parchment, scored the loaf haphazardly, it was so soft, and chucked it in the Dutch oven. 

All that to say, it came out... ok. I haven’t cut it yet, too hot, BUT I want my loaves to be tall and beautiful and round! Not squatty. What are some tips for a higher hydration? Is even my house (air conditioned at 75) too warm for my starter/proofs? The dough felt really good when I was shaping and I felt like I had made a pretty good taught outer skin, but it just smooshed when I dumped it out of its proving bowl lined with towel. 

Will attach pic of outside of loaf! Hope the posts not too long 🙈

Oh, and formula: 400g KA bread flour, 100g generic whole wheat, 400g filtered water, 10g salt, 110g starter at 100% hydration.

,AskBaking,"Hey all, I have a choc chip cookie recipe that's been in the family for ages but I've always kinda wondered if it could be improved upon and stuff. Recipe is as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

- 2 eggs

- 1/2 cup softened margarine or butter

- 2 tsp baking soda

- 2 tsp vanilla extract

- 1 cup brown sugar

- 1/2 cup white sugar

- 1 cup choc chips of choice

- 2 cups ap flour

&amp;nbsp;

Now I could be missing something for ingredients here as I'm rattling them off by memory so if I forgot something obvious forgive me. I know I should probably use butter instead of margarine but oh well. I guess I'm mostly concerned with the amount of flour? Usually it's fine but I made cookies the other day and they werent.... that good. I followed the recipe but after watching What's Eating Dan on youtube and his vid about cookies I melted the margarine, used 1 egg white with 2 yolks (like he suggests) and it was super super super super dry. So I added in that other white as I hadn't tossed it yet and it moistened back up some. The other issue I think was that I guess we had dark brown sugar instead of light? I honestly don't know how much difference it makes on using one or the other but I can tell you instead of having like a usual crisp cookie it was kind of dense? It reminded me of a molasses cookie with it's consistency and I don't know what part of everything caused it.

,AskBaking,"Hello lovely bakers 

I love macarons, they're one of my favorite delicasies. I've made them 4 times now and out of those times, 2 times have been failures. One of the succeeded ones was a box mix.

The most recent one was a foolproof chocolate macaron recipe which offered a really nice helping guide and super precise instructions i think i did follow well, but I ended up with one sheet of hollow shells and second sheet of spread ones. 

I knew beforehand that there is going to be about a million ways to make a mistake which will kill the whole batch, but i find it an issue that there seems to be infinite amounts of variables that will lead to an unsuccesful cookie.

Fe. the instructions say to beat the egg whites for 6 minutes. How do I know my beaters will be fast/slow enough? What kind of stiff/soft/semihard peaks are the right kind of peaks? What kind of pressure should i have when stirring the baked though? Instructions said to fold 74 times, but what if that isn't enough? How will I know my oven's 160 celsius is the same as the recipe's 160 celsius? 

I feel like while wondering these things the macarons are sensing my fear and from there go ruined just to fuck with me. 

I'm  pretty sure everyone here has had at least some problems like this. So my question is that is there some way to sort out the different variables that may lead to unsuccessful cookies? (can be applied to any kind of baking i guess) 

also, has anyone had any experience making macarons in bigger batches in advance to parties etc. and how did that work out? I was planning to make these to a graduation party to around 60 people and i really hope i wouldn't have to abandon this idea if there is something that could to wrong

Chai-Spiced Banana Upside-Down Cake

 
Author: Sasha Gill

Recipe type: Vegan

Serves: 8-10

Ingredients

Banana Layer

¼ cup vegan butter

¾ cup light brown sugar

¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

3 tablespoons dark rum

3 large ripe bananas, peeled

Cake

⅔ cup soy milk

2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar

⅓ cup vegan butter

¾ cup white sugar

⅓ cup mashed banana (about 1 banana)

¼ cup double-strength chai tea*

3 tbsp aquafaba

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking soda

1 teaspoon baking powder

¼ teaspoon salt

1 tsp cinnamon

1 tsp ginger

¼ tsp nutmeg

Optional - A pinch of cloves, allspice, or cardamom powder

Instructions

Preheat the oven to 180C and grease an 8-inch round cake tin, and line the bottom. I used a springform tin to make it easier to unfold but a regular pan should work too.

Place the butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring frequently to dissolve the sugar. Add the rum and simmer gently on medium heat for 4 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes then tip into the base of the tin. I like to reserve a few tablespoons of this caramel to brush over the cake when it is done, but this is optional and if you prefer to keep it simple, just tip all of the syrup into the tin.

Slice the bananas lengthways and place cut side down in the tin, trimming them to fit and cover the base. Set aside.

In a small bowl, mix the soy milk and vinegar together. Leave this for five minutes to allow the milk to thicken. Meanwhile, cream the vegan butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy.

&lt;p&gt;Chai-Spiced Banana Upside-Down Cake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
Author: Sasha Gill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recipe type: Vegan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serves: 8-10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingredients&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banana Layer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¼ cup vegan butter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¾ cup light brown sugar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 tablespoons dark rum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 large ripe bananas, peeled&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⅔ cup soy milk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⅓ cup vegan butter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¾ cup white sugar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⅓ cup mashed banana (about 1 banana)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¼ cup double-strength chai tea*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 tbsp aquafaba&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 cups all-purpose flour&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 teaspoon baking soda&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 teaspoon baking powder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¼ teaspoon salt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 tsp cinnamon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 tsp ginger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¼ tsp nutmeg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optional - A pinch of cloves, allspice, or cardamom powder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 180C and grease an 8-inch round cake tin, and line the bottom. I used a springform tin to make it easier to unfold but a regular pan should work too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place the butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring frequently to dissolve the sugar. Add the rum and simmer gently on medium heat for 4 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes then tip into the base of the tin. I like to reserve a few tablespoons of this caramel to brush over the cake when it is done, but this is optional and if you prefer to keep it simple, just tip all of the syrup into the tin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slice the bananas lengthways and place cut side down in the tin, trimming them to fit and cover the base. Set aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a small bowl, mix the soy milk and vinegar together. Leave this for five minutes to allow the milk to thicken. Meanwhile, cream the vegan butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Next, stir in the thickened soy milk mixture, mashed banana, chai tea, aquafaba and vanilla. Mix this well. Now, sift in the flour, baking soda, powder, salt, and spices together. Fold until just combined, taking care not to overmix. The batter should be fairly thick but still pourable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gently pour the batter over the bananas, taking care not to dislodge them and even the top out with a spatula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bake for 45-50 minutes until puffed and golden and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 5-10 minutes then run a knife around the inside of the tin. Invert the cake onto a serving plate or board. Serve warm&lt;/p&gt;

Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I attempted to bake a chiffon cake twice last night and both attempts failed dramatically.  I'll attempt to include all relevant information below.

\-

Recipe:

* Whisk together:
   * 10 1/2 oz sugar
   * 5 1/3 oz cake flour
   * 2 teaspoons baking powder
   * 1/2 teaspoon salt
* Mix:
   * 2 large eggs (room temperature)
   * 3/4 cup water
   * 1/2 cup vegetable oil
   * 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
   * 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
* Mix the two above bowls together to form a batter
* Separately whisked with a hand mixer to firm peaks:
   * 5 egg whites (room temperature)
   * 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
* Fold egg whites into the batter and pour into 16 cup tube pan (lined, but not greased).
   * I just put parchment paper on the bottom of the tube pan
* Bake at 325 for 55 minutes, turn half way through.
* cool upside down completely, cut sides with a knife to remove.

\-

**Attempt 1...**  When I poured the batter into the pan I noticed that I hadn't done enough folding of the egg whites in.  parts were too fluffy and parts were were too runny.   I tried to give an extra stir in the pan, but I think this was an obvious problem of the first attempt.  The cake rose very high in the oven but started to shrink not long after i turned it.  My guess is the high point was about 3x the volume of the original batter.  By the time I took the cake out it was about 2x the volume of the original batter (didn't seem like a complete deal breaker?  I'm not sure....  I'm quite new to baking).

What happened next was consistent between the two bakes.   About 2 minutes after turning upside down most of the cake fell out.  Some remained stuck to the sides, but the cake wasn't strong enough to hold itself together and anything not touching a side fell out.  Once this happened it quickly deflated from the original 3"" height to 1"" of gummy mess.

\-

**Attempt 2...** everything here is the same except I fully mixed the whites and the batter.  The rise in the oven wasn't quite as dramatic, but looked good.  The following shrink did seem worse however as the cake started to fold in on itself.  After removing from the oven and turning over I had the same issue with the bulk of the cake plopping out.

\-

My gut tells me that I'm still messing up two things.

1. **The cake is falling out while cooling** \-  I assume the cake is too heavy for its structure.  I'm tempted to cut the water from 3/4 a cup to 1/2 a cup and see if this happens again.  The batter itself has been pretty runny so far.
2. **The rise and fall of the cake in the oven** \- This feels like a temperature problem.  My oven usually runs pretty close to the temperature I set it at, but I didn't have my thermometer in last night to double check.  The fall always happened at some point after the turn.  My guess is the temperature is ok, but that the fluctuation is too dramatic when i turn the cake?  I might wait longer to turn it or even not turn it at all?  I'm very much open to suggestions here because I'm not quite sure what's going on.

&amp;#x200B;

1/2 tsp salt

I have a feeling the oven may have been running a bit hot. I don't have an oven thermometer.

Otherwise the cake turned out perfectly, and I suppose if I were doing this professionally I would probably cut the top part off anyway, but I was curious if anyone has seen this happen before, because I never had.

And most of the cakes I've seen online are poke cakes with a thin layer of coconut buttercream in the center, which isn't what I'm looking for. I'd like to make something with a similar thickness to a momofuku milk bar cake: I want the coconut layer to be equal in thickness to the cake layers!

,AskBaking,"I love big 5 - 6 oz chocolate chip cookies and am going crazy with recipe experiments. My goal is to create a large cookie I can serve warm with melty chocolate without the center coming across overly wet &amp; gooey. I'm here for a second pair of eyes because I'm going in circles.

Note- They need to be baked cold rather than immediately after dough is made.

[This recipe](https://www.modernhoney.com/levain-bakery-chocolate-chip-crush-cookies/), with 3 cups/18 oz chocolate chips and omitting nuts, was my starting point.

In comparison, [this recipe](https://www.brittneylongcurations.com/copycat-crumbl-cookies-recipe/) has the same egg but more butter, sugar &amp; flour. However, the cookies have a grainy exterior from undissolved sugar [seen here.](https://imgur.com/mNoRopr) Delicious but not perfect.

While not necessarily dry, both of these become pretty hard at room temp. Bummer! Is it even possible to get cookies this big to be soft at room temp while not overly gooey warm?

Hello, I was hoping I could get some advice! Sugar cookies are normally my game — this will be the first cake I’ve attempted. I want to try [this recipe](https://iscreamforbuttercream.com/favorite-vanilla-bean-cake/), but am wanting to make three 8” round pans instead of two. 

Using a recipe scaler tool, it gave me the following measurements:

* 4 1/2 cups cake flour
* 3 cups sugar
* 2 1/4 tsp baking powder
* 3/4 tsp baking soda
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 cup butter
* 1 1/2 cup sour cream
* 3/4 cup whole milk
* 1 1/2 tbsp oil
* 1 1/2 tbsp vanilla bean paste
* 3/4 tsp almond emulsion
* 4.5 eggs

**My questions:**
* Does the above scaling seem accurate to you? Should I go with 4 or 5 eggs?
* Is this too risky for a noob who hasn’t used this recipe before to attempt? Or should it be fine since everything is supposedly in proportion?

Any other advice/thoughts on the recipe itself/etc greatly appreciated. I may play it safe this time and stick to the original but still curious for future use.

,AskBaking," I'm still struggling to make good pancakes.

My problem is that I can't find the happy medium for well-cooked pancakes. Either I completely burn the outside to properly cook the inside, or the outside looks black and the inside is gooey. It doesn't seem like there's an in-between.

,AskBaking,"**UPDATE: Wow, thanks so much everyone! I used your suggestions and cake #2 came out super fluffy. I can't imagine why this recipe calls for all-purpose instead of cake flour, but the cake flour really made the cake perfect.**

I have a recipe for a cake that calls for all-purpose flour, but last time I made it, it felt a little too dense. I assume using cake flour instead will improve the recipe. I've searched for an answer to the question of ""can I replace all-purpose flour with cake flour"", but it seems the only questions I find seem to be the *opposite* of what I'm asking.

The questions I have are:

• Can I/should I use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour?

• If I use cake flour instead, should I adjust the amount? The recipe currently calls for 3 cups of all-purpose flour.

• A little unrelated to the flour issue, but I live in Denver, and am still not 100% sure on the proper high-altitude adjustments for baked goods.

,AskBaking,"Hello, I am pretty good at baking all sorts of things but have been afraid to try breads with yeast for a long time because it seems so complex. I had a goal to learn to bake a polish cheese babka for my family before easter. Given that easter is in like a week, I dont think this is going to be perfect by then! But I'm still trying. My family used to get this bread at a polish bakery all the time but it has fallen out of fashion I think and the chocolate and cinnamon type dense babkas have become more popular. The last few years it has been basically impossible to get. The only stores I can find it are at like supermarkets around easter time and of course they are loaded with preservatives and junk. So I thought, maybe I could learn to make it and release my family from this frustration!!! 

However, I'm having an issue with the bread and despite my research I can't figure out what is wrong. I am following a recipe here https://hostessatheart.com/cheese-babka-twelveloaves/ but I have baked it twice and found the texture is not what I'm used to. If I didn't stuff it with sweet cheese, it would taste to me like a regular old white bread. It's good. But it's not the babka type texture, which is meant to be light and soft. I have tried kneading the dough more this time around. It think its a bit softer but still not what I was looking for. It rises great both times and bakes well. I have also seen some other recipes that use more flour and egg yolks instead of whole eggs. I tried to search for things like, what makes bread soft but all the websites that came up seem to say its about not rising enough or not kneading enough. Is it possible I'm still not kneading enough??? How long do you knead for? I think I did for like 3-5 minutes. The rise seemed fine so I dont think its my yeast. This is the other recipie I found https://www.beneaththecrust.com/blog/2018/3/27/sweet-cheese-babka This one has the crumb topping, which is also usually a hallmark of cheese babka.

I had a goal to learn to bake a polish cheese babka for my family before easter. Given that easter is in like a week, I dont think this is going to be perfect by then! But I&amp;#39;m still trying. My family used to get this bread at a polish bakery all the time but it has fallen out of fashion I think and the chocolate and cinnamon type dense babkas have become more popular. The last few years it has been basically impossible to get. The only stores I can find it are at like supermarkets around easter time and of course they are loaded with preservatives and junk. So I thought, maybe I could learn to make it and release my family from this frustration!!! &lt;/p&gt;

[recipe](https://www.sugarhero.com/swiss-meringue-buttercream-recipe/)



It came together well and I ended up with a silky smooth buttercream. I love the texture but I’m not crazy about the taste.

Is there anything I can do to cut that butter flavour and lighten it up a bit? Would adding powdered sugar work now?

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: More people are saying that was just color from the fruits and unfortunately I threw the cake away before investigating further, so I can&amp;#39;t say for sure what happened: if the piece I tasted just happened to taste bad (or some sort of placebo effect) or it was actually moldy.

,AskBaking,"I've been working at a donut shop in Canada for the past 5 months and we've been having a problem with our donuts ""deflating"" after proofing. 

We have tried almost everything. 
Changing cutters, dough thickness, mixing time, proofing time, table time, the amount of yeast, the amount of scraps re-mixed into the dough, the order in which we put the bags of dough in the fridge. (we do an overnight cold proof and then the second proof in an actual proofer)


The main things that have changed that might contribute to the problem are:

1. We changed cutters, but we switched back to the original with no difference in product.

2. We bought a new proofer (I think it's related to this)

4. We are creating much larger quantities of dough than prior to 5 months ago, this means there's less space in our fridge for air flow.

3. I was hired (I would like to imagine that I am not the problem)


Our proofer is set to 26C and 80% humidity and we proof for round 30 minutes. 

The overnight proof lasts around 15 hours and it's in a 4C fridge, we are buying a new walk in fridge because the one we have now is so small that there is basically no air circulation (the current fridge is not a walk in.) (This may also contribute to the problem)

We proof the cut donuts in large batches around 240 donuts each spread over 10 racks in the proofer, for some reason our second batch always comes out a little better.

Our oil Temperature is 375F and we're using canola oil.

I unfortunately cannot share the recipe because I have a signed agreement to not share it, but I can give the yeast % or sugar % if needed.

The model on the bottom says RRKP50. It's a lift bowl machine. Here's what the model looks like (not my photo).

I've ordered several dough hooks that say they'll work with this model. However when I receive them they're too short to reach low enough in the bowl to work. I have the original dough hook, however it's coating is coming off so I don't want to use it.

Here's a photo of the original dough hook and the new one I got. I cannot seem to find the correct one. I've bought two different replacements.

A in the photo is the correct, original dough hook.

B is the replacements I keep getting.

I have a few questions. I'm trying to recreate a cake I had a while back. I need to make a lemon layer and the problem is I'm not sure if it was a jelly or a curd or cremeux?

I've tried a lemon jelly today from scratch with lemon juice, gelatine and caster sugar but I didn't bring the lemon juice to a boil so maybe that's why it's so bitter?

,AskBaking,"I have been trying to learn the art and science of bread baking. I started with Chef John's sandwich roll recipe because of how they looked when he baked them, as well as their simplicity. The recipe: 

&amp;#x200B;

19 ounces of Bread Flour (Weighed)

1 1/2 Cups water (Between 100 and 110 degrees F)

1 1/2 tsp Salt

1 Packet of yeast

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I mix the yeast, water and a little flour, make sure it's active, add everything, knead in mixer with dough hook for a few minutes. Spritz bowl with canola oil, set dough in, and place in turned off stove with towel over it to rise (90-120 mins until doubled). From there, I knead it down, cut into pieces, roll into balls, let rest 10 mins, then roll it into sandwich roll shape, cover and let rise again (60-90 mins). This is where my problem is! It doubles in size again (or close to it), but it doesn't hold itself up, so instead of getting a round loaf, it's flat on the bottom and looks like a deformed ciabatta, denser than it should be. I can't raise it longer, as it would flatten more, and I can't raise it shorter, as it would be way too small. Could working the dough for longer or shorter periods at certain stages affect it?

,AskBaking,"**TL;DR:** Where can I find a guide to the traditional savory baked goods and breads of the Middle East and North Africa?

-----

I live in Detroit, Michigan (USA). We have long been a destination for peoples immigrating to the US from the Middle East and North Africa, particularly Arabs. As a result, we have a wealth of outstanding food from every corner of that region.

The entrees and salads and soups and sides found in restaurants are widespread and well-known by nearly everyone here, transcending race and socioeconomics, but for some reason the bakeries have never found the same broad assimilation in our metro's food culture. As a result, I could practically give a Ted Talk on the history and modern role of things like hummus and kibbe and sujuk and falafel; or about the differences between food from the Levant, the Arabian peninsula, or Northwest Africa; or about the rules of halal preparation and how those purposes are reflected in other facets of hospitality and food culture in those countries...

...but when I walk in the front door of an Arab bakery, I don't have the first damn clue what I'm looking at. If it's not a flatbread (pita/khubz, lavash, injera), I probably don't know what it is. Typically the staff are seniors who speak little or no English, and if there's anything written down, it's in Arabic (which I can't read or speak). Everything in the cases or the back shelves looks delicious, but I hate having to communicate by pointing, and I hate having to roll the dice by picking things at random since I have no idea what's on them or in them.

It's fairly easy to find guides to the sweet pastries of the region and culture, but I'd really like to learn more about the savory bread-based items. There are all sorts of pizzas and hand pies and breads with fillings and breads with toppings, and I don't know what any of it is. I'd like to be able to order a little less awkwardly, but I'd also like to be able to research each item (food history is a hobby of mine) and possibly bake it at home, and I can't do any of that if I don't even know the names.

,AskBaking,"Hello fellow baking enthusiasts! 

I have a Mennonite cookbook published in 1983 and there’s a recipe brought over from Russia called Russian Peppernuts that calls for 2 cups dark syrup - I think this means dark corn syrup, however I was unsure if it could be molasses or another kind of syrup? 

According to the notes at the bottom the recipe originated in the 1800s sometime (possibly late 1800s.) The notes state that they’re not soft peppernuts, they were baked before boarding the ship for a long voyage and soaked in milk or coffee. They keep more many months in a covered container, and taste better with age.

,AskBaking,"Hi all,
It's not a big issue but it's annoying. I have Mrs. Fields cookie recipe and towards the end of the batch, there's a bunch of cookie goodies that aren't really binding together.

TLDR of the recipe:1:1:1 of butter, sugar, and brown sugar with a bunch of oatmeal and flower with other goodies added in

Recipe:

2 C. butter

2 C. white sugar

2 C. brown sugar

4 Eggs

2 Tbs Vanilla (or a bit more)

4 C. flour

5 C. oatmeal

1 tsp salt

2 tsp baking powder

2 tsp baking soda

24 oz choc. chips

3 cups chopped nuts (I do walnuts or pecans, depending on whats on sale.

Cream the butter and sugars together, add vanilla and eggs. Mix well add in dry ingredients. Bake at usual time and temp. Normally I let the dough chill an hour or more before I start to bake them for flavor and moisture to do its thing.

[Picture of dough](https://imgur.com/a/y72OvnK). 

I've figured it's a hydration issue of some sort. Either not through mixing (recipe as is makes enough to fill most of 32 C. Tupperware bowl or 7.8 Liter bowl for my metric friends) or there's not enough liquid/fat for the recipe as it stands. 

(/s)Obviously this is something I'm super worried about because I'm bringing them to work.

For real though, I'm not losing sleep over it and I'm totally willing to play around with the recipe, I just don't know where to start and really don't feel like taste testing 12 dozen cookies every few days.

How many times would recommend sifting the flour? I've seen as few as three times and as much as six!

,AskBaking,"Hello!

So yesterday I followed this recipe to make chocolate chip cookies:
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10813/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/

The only change to the recipe I made was that I did 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar to make them chewier (as many people on the recipe's review section suggested).

They turned out tasting great, but not looking how the pictures showed them to look and the texture was a bit different then the recipe described.

The ending up not ""melting"" as they baked, they just stayed in the form I globed them on to the tray. They didn't end up having that flat cookie look with golden edges. The texture was pretty consistent throughout the whole cookie, they didn't have crispy edges and chewy centers.

Is this because of the extra brown sugar? Or could something else have caused this?

,AskBaking,"I have been learning how to bake from scratch. I am interested in WHY they combine things in certain ways and WHY that combination is this kind of product and not another. I have read ""Cooking for geeks"", ""Flavor Bible"", and ""Ratio"". They all describe their specific concepts neatly but none of them actually convey a complete concept that you can actually apply.

Eg 1. A recipe that makes soupy muffins, burnt tops, and uncooked grey centers as the ""ratio"" is off, even though the author talks about adhering to ratios.

    1 cup - Chopped Strawberries
    1.5 cups - Flour
    1.5 tsp - Baking powder
    1 tsp - Salt
    0.5 tsp - Baking soda
    1 cup - Sugar
    2 - Eggs
    0.5 cups - Mashed banana
    0.25 cups - Veg oil
    1 tsp - Vanilla extract
    1 cup - Blueberries

Now I knew as soon as this was mixed it was WAY to runny and all that fruit would juice quite a bit. But as I am learning and the library book is from an author who talks about ratios I would just follow the recipe. Well I cooked them as prescribed in a greased muffin tin and the centers were soggy and they collapsed.

Now here is a recipe from a baking book from the 1960's I inherited. They work perfectly every time. I weighed the ingredients to see if even this ""followed the ratios""

Eg 2. Good muffins

    (50g) 1 - Egg
    (187g) 0.75 cups - Milk
    (53g) 0.25 cups - Veg oil
    (260g) 2 cups - Flour
    (2g) 0.5 tsb - Salt
    (6g) 2 tsb - Baking powder
    (110g) 0.5 cup - Sugar

So if this is the golden muffin Ratio:

    3 - Flour, 1 - Fat, 2 - Liquid, 1 - Egg

The first recipie is so complex I don't even know how to figure out its ratios. But for the 1960's one:

    5.2 - Flour, 1 - Fat, 3.74 - Liquid, 1 - Egg
    Is ""Flour"" all the dry ingredients?
    If so then it's 7.56 - Flour

So what good is the actual concept of ratio if nothing follows it and I have no examples?

The whole point of this is 2 fold. EVERYTHING now days uses a butt load of sugar. 1+ cups of sugar in a dozen muffins is sickening, I need to know how to reduce it. And the main point of learning the WHY is, say I have 2 bananas, almonds and 1.5 cups of buttermilk to use up. HOW do I actually combine those ingredients into a reliable product without a recipe???

Is there a book that actually teaches this as a whole concept without going to a ""school""?",t2_aud54,False,,0,False,"Ratios make no sense, how to learn properly",[],r/AskBaking,False,,,0,,False,t3_augo66,False,light,,public,10,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},General,False,10,,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1551096087.0,text,,,,text,self.AskBaking,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been learning how to bake from scratch.

,AskBaking,"Hey all, I'm on my phone so sorry about the formatting and such. I also wasn't sure if I used the proper flair, I'll change it if I'm wrong.

I have been baking for the mechanics at work lately. I've made mini pumpkin pie tarts and Swiss rolls (strawberry/buttercream and cinnamon/lemon curd). Yesterday, they asked me if I could make them truffles the next time I swing by the shop.

It seems a fairly simple recipe to follow but I don't really want to make just a regular chocolate truffle. I was thinking of adding fruit flavors or coffee or some sort of spice but at what point should I add it?? Do I go with artificial flavor or zest or finely chopped/mashed?? 

I'm at a loss of when to add the flavor to the chocolate mix. Half of me thinks to add the zest or flavoring to the cream as it's heating up, the other half thinks to mix it in the same time as the chocolate. 

Also, I saw some recipes call for liqueur. Can you taste the alcohol or catch a buzz from too many truffles?? If so, I'll have to exclude it as I will be taking these into work with a very strict zero tolerance for drinking at work.

Last night I tried making just a basic cake and added in a tablespoon of both cardamom and cinnamon, only to have it collapse in the middle and also taste like a zucchini or banana bread cake. Given that the coffee is the most dominant flavor in my idea, should I do a coffee syrup and infuse a plain cake with it and then a maple/cinnamon/cardamom buttercream? &lt;/p&gt;

,AskBaking,"Hi! I am just finishing up a batch of candied/glace/confit orange slices. I've been following the old school French method of slowly raising the baume/brix little by little, once a day, for almost two weeks now. They look and taste wonderful and are definitely ready to be ""finished"". Unfortunately, resources that I have for finishing are all a bit... unclear. The easiest way is just to package them in their own syrup, but I would like something a bit less gooey/bulky. I know they can simply be washed and dried or rubbed in sanding sugar, but what I am particularly interested in is ""glazing"" or icing them. 

The recipe I'm using, which also reflects footage I've seen, offers a slightly translucent, shiny coating. In this recipe, you are to bring a 1000 g sugar and 300 g water to 239° at which point you ""carefully"" rub the spatula on the side of the pot thereby crystallizing a ""a small portion"" which you are then supposed to ""delicately"" mix in so that the candies take on a slightly crystallized glaze. Obviously, once the sugar begins to crystallize there is very little time left before the syrup is completely seized. In my experience, what time there is typically leaves a glaze that is large in crystal structure and not at all shiny. 

I've experimented with taking the sugar to 310° which leaves a wonderful, thin slightly crunchy, shiny like glass glaze on the candies. I actually love this glaze and don't mind if this is what I end up stuck with, but the perfectionist in me wants to know what the hell this guy is talking about. 

Information on this entire process is slim to say the least and a lot of what I can find seems to be in French. I was hoping someone out there might be able to offer some guidance! 

To sweeten the deal, I am about to start a batch of whole tangerines (lil cuties) and would be happy to send a finished one your way should your wisdom lead to the perfection of the glaze.

The recipe calls for a fresh yeast cake which has proven to be impossible to find in my town. I'm still very new to baking and don't really know how to compensate for it in the recipe. I tried google but it didn't really help me in my exact context. 

  

***NUT BREAD***

(Kolacz)

· 1 yeast cake

· ¼ Cup of water

· 1 tsp. Salt

· 6 or more cups of flour (sifted)

· 2 large eggs

· 2 Cups Carnation evaporated milk

· ¾ Cup Sugar

In a large mixing bowl dissolve yeast cake in lukewarm water. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy

Add milk to dissolved yeast and stir. Add 3 cups of flour and beat well. Mix in creamed butter and sugar,

Add eggs and blend. Gradually add the remainder of the salt and flour a ½ cup at a time, until the dough is smooth enough to handle. Knead the remaining flour into the dough, in the bowl.

The dough should be smooth and elastic to the touch, and never hard or stiff, in fact, for fluffy bread, the dough should be a little on the soft side yet beaten or kneaded well to avoid stickiness.

Place the dough on a floured cloth and cover. Allow to rise until double in size. About an hour.

Do I skip dissolving the yeast and just add dry yeast when I'm mixing everything else?

,AskBaking,"I took my first stab at biscotti tonight using this lovely sounding [orange, almond, and date biscotti recipe](http://www.christinamarsigliese.com/2012/09/orange-date-almond-biscotti.html) from a blog I'm not familiar with. I chose them specifically because I was wanting to use up my dates, but this is my first time making biscotti. 

All and all, everything went well, but I noticed that the final result was very crumbly and as a result, I couldn't cut the biscotti as thin as I would have liked so it didn't get particularly crunchy. 

The taste was amazing though and they weren't hard to make, so I think I'd like to try again! I am wondering if the issue here isn't the fat content and was considering adding an extra 1/4C butter, baking the loaves a bit longer, letting them cool completely before slicing (30min plus), then baking at least 10 minutes on each side for the second bake. 

Do the above changes sound like they'd yield a better biscotti or does anyone have a recipe suggestion for a biscotti I could add dates and a bit of orange extra to? :)

I chose them specifically because I was wanting to use up my dates, but this is my first time making biscotti. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All and all, everything went well, but I noticed that the final result was very crumbly and as a result, I couldn&amp;#39;t cut the biscotti as thin as I would have liked so it didn&amp;#39;t get particularly crunchy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The taste was amazing though and they weren&amp;#39;t hard to make, so I think I&amp;#39;d like to try again! I am wondering if the issue here isn&amp;#39;t the fat content and was considering adding an extra 1/4C butter, baking the loaves a bit longer, letting them cool completely before slicing (30min plus), then baking at least 10 minutes on each side for the second bake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do the above changes sound like they&amp;#39;d yield a better biscotti or does anyone have a recipe suggestion for a biscotti I could add dates and a bit of orange extra to? :) &lt;/p&gt;

In just under 30 days our numbers have skyrocketed from 1082 members to 9925. This is largely thanks to u/imightbemary for mentioning us during an r/AskReddit thread. Moderating for you nearly 10,000 bakers has been amazing. I really cannot say enough about how great you all are. Before my eyes start to sweat, let's just jump right in!  

-------------

##Rules Updates

We've added two new rules: **Use the Search Feature**, and **We Are Not Google**. Essentially these rules are to encourage people to look for the answer to their question before posting it as I've seen several of the same questions posted numerous times over the last few days, and the second is to prevent people from trying to turn this into their own personal Pintrest Board of recipes.  

If you ever notice a rule violation, please remember to report it. It's the community that makes this place amazing, and I'd like your help keeping it that way.

-----------

##Mod Applications

That being said, I definitely can't do this on my own. While I've been able to keep up for the most part, there are just so many posts incoming I can hardly keep up to review them all! I'm finally ready to ask for help. The first thing you have to know is this is kind of a cake-walk (pun intended). We don't get a ton of reports/spam, but sometimes people do trigger the AutoMod. I'm looking for 3-5 awesome, inspired, passionate bakers to help me out with this. You can find our [application here](https://goo.gl/forms/44B079qNsR2OADX22) and I'll be adding a sidebar button as well. Mod applications will be rolling, and as the need arises we'll pull from the list to ask for help.

I&amp;#39;ve been trying to incorporate flaxseed to &amp;quot;bulk up&amp;quot; the dough, but I just get a sticky mess no matter how much flour I seem to add. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can use as a grain free alternative to oats that will help thicken the dough? I have to be careful using animal by-products (legally) but have permission to trial recipes using eggs. Hope this makes sense and any feedback would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

,AskBaking,"Hi!

My little nephew loves chocolate chip cookies, and he asks me to bake him some every time we meet. The problem is, there seems to be something wrong with the way I bake them or maybe I just haven't found the right recipe yet.

I've tried the:
1. Tasy recipe - it's good but gets crunchy the next day or two. [Recipe](https://tasty.co/recipe/the-best-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies)
2. Sally's baking addiction - a little chewy, but more cakey than chewy. [Recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-chocolate-chunk-cookies/)

Am I doing something wrong? I followed the recipes step by step, and I don't know what else to do. Hope you can share your favorites with me so I can try them too. 🙂

Thank you x

I've been looking at information online to find that ways to obtain a crackled outer layer like the one pictured, and I've found a couple of (possible?) ways to get it. 


* reduce the overall moisture in the recipe (ie. less eggs, possibly browning butter?)
* over leaven the cookie.
* take cookies out of oven while they are raw, allowing them to collapse on themselves, resulting cracks.


For reference, the cookie in question is from Cafe Madeleine in Boston. I think that I might have seen them putting their, possibly cold, cookies on baking sheets in the rough shape of a puck. Could the shaping and the fact that the cookie might be put into the oven cold play a role?

,AskBaking,"Hi there,

I'm planning to make my boyfriend cheesecake for his birthday on Wednesday. The only thing is I want it to be a surprise but since we live together, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do that. I have some ideas but would like the opinion of expert bakers (so glad this subreddit exists haha) before deciding which one to go with.

 I was thinking of prepping the filling today and then storing it in another fridge until Wednesday to bake it. I'm just wondering if doing that will ruin or alter the filling? (Leaving it the fridge for two days) 

Or, my second option is to make the cheesecake today and leave it in the fridge until Wednesday. Would that affect the ""freshness"" of the cake? I also might be on a time crunch as he gets off earlier today than on Wednesday. But I know some recipes call to chill the cake for x hours before serving and doing this option would give me plenty of time to cool whereas Wednesday might be tight. 

What do you think? 

Also, if you know a good (and simple) cheesecake recipe then I would love to check it out! I'm looking for a plain cheesecake recipe or something with blueberry in it. I bought a 6 inch springform pan.

,AskBaking,"So I'll start off saying that I'm a cook, not a baker... However, I'm also celiac and there's no good gluten free baker near me. I have big milestone birthday coming up so I want to make my own birthday cake. Since I have real experience baking, and even less with GF baking, I decided to go the Flourless Cake route. 

I tried this [recipe](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/flourless-chocolate-cake-recipe). (I didn't do the ganache and honestly it doesn't need it.) The flavor is delicious! It's seriously good and it's been hard to keep myself from downing the whole cake. 

What I'm wondering is a few things: 

1) The texture is halfway between a brownie and a cake, is there leavening agent I can add that would make it rise just a bit without affecting the taste too much? 

2) I'm hoping to make individual cakes, either in mini-cupcake size or in a silicone mold that's like a mini-loaf (holds about 2 TBSP batter each). I baked the first try in the mini-loaf, but the loafs stuck terribly. I tried the waiting ~5 minutes but that was the worst. Completely crumbled apart. I got a couple of loafs entire out completely when cool but only 2 out of 8. How can I better prepare the pan so allow for easier removal (I did spray with non-stick)? Would popping in the refrigerator until cold work?

3) If I can't do individual, if I bake it in one pan, should I use a spring form?

There's usually whipped cream in the center (under the marron cream), but I'm looking for an alternative, as my boyfriend just isn't too fond of dairy whipped cream.

,AskBaking,"Hi all, I’m a novice baker, experienced and curious but ultimately a hobbyist just doing it for the fun of things. One of my favorite things to make is a cheesecake. I’ve been sitting in this idea for a rose cheesecake with raspberries, or possibly rose and vanilla with a raspberry rose sauce and I’m inquiring if anyone has either a good tip on how to use incorporate rose flavors into a cheesecake or a recipe for one?

It seems like rose flavoring is typically a rose water and sometimes a rose extract. I’m wondering if that’s the best way to go for something like a rose cheesecake or custard, as such desserts are sensitive to water content and seem to do better with alcohol based extracts or oils.

,AskBaking,"Hello all,

My husband's birthday party is on Sunday and I am making him cheesecakes as is traditional for us. The catch is that this year my ""weekends"" are midweek, so I can't do a bunch of baking on the Saturday. 

The recipes I plan to make are a [lemon/lime](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/237435/lemon-lime-cheesecake/) and an [espresso](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7384/chocolate-cappuccino-cheesecake/)cheesecake. I use the prepared graham/cookie crusts from the grocery store because I'm classy like that. 

I only make cheesecakes once a year, so I'm not super experienced with them. I have two questions:

1. Can I assemble the cheesecakes ahead of time, store them in the fridge, and then bake them the night before?
2. If I make and bake them today or tomorrow and then freeze them (and then take them out to thaw Saturday afternoon), will they thaw alright in the store-bought crumb crusts?

I would greatly appreciate any wisdom that you could provide me about this.

&amp;#x200B;

I made 25 little gift bags of Cornbread mix for our annual Christmas Party... only I put corn FLOUR instead of corn MEAL (thank you, crappy french translation)!!! I realized my error a couple days after making the gift bags. I made one today and it tastes... off... as you can imagine. Texture and taste are off.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any salvaging this? Can I add corn meal? What else would I have to add to make sure that it works?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to throw them out, as that would be a huge waste of ingredients and money.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the recipe I used (from [geniuskitchen.com](https://geniuskitchen.com)):

* **1cup** [**flour**](https://www.geniuskitchen.com/about/flour-64)
* **1cup** [**cornmeal**](https://www.geniuskitchen.com/about/cornmeal-59) **(this is where I put the corn flour instead) :(**
* **1teaspoon** [**salt**](https://www.geniuskitchen.com/about/salt-359)
* **1⁄3cup** [**powdered milk**](https://www.geniuskitchen.com/about/milk-360)
* **1tablespoon** [**baking powder**](https://www.geniuskitchen.com/about/baking-powder-6)

&amp;#x200B;

And here is the method attached: 

1. Sift dry ingredients into mixing bowl.
2. In small bowl, combine 1 cup water, 1 egg, and 1/3 cup oil.
3. Stir into dry ingredients and mix well.
4. Pour into a well-buttered pie plate.
5. Bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes, or until golden.

&amp;#x200B;

I watch the butter/sugar and stop when it looks lighter and fluffy, typically 3-4 mins on kitchenaid level 4 starting from cold cubed butter.

Lately, I've been making [these japanese milk buns](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/japanese-milk-bread-rolls-recipe) for burgers.

,AskBaking,"Hello Bakers! (I've always wanted to say that).

As some of you may have noticed, there have been some changes to the sub as of late... I've tried to bring us into the ""modern area"" so to speak. I have no skill at CSS, so the ability under the 'new Reddit' to customize this sub as been extremely helpful.

To date the changes we've made are:

* New Banner
* New Icon
* New Post Flair
* New User Flair
* Rules updates/post removal reason updates

# New Post Flair

Under the heading of New Post Flair, you'll now find that you can add a flair to your post which will help people identify the issue you are having. Suggestions for new flair are welcome, and please remember to flair your posts to help expedite answers to your questions! We've added flair for:

* General Questions
* Baking Equipment Questions
* Bread
* Dough
* Pie
* Cakes
* Pastry
* Creams, Sauces, &amp; Syrups
* Custards, Mousses, and Souffles
* Meta (anything about the subreddit)

# New User Flair

Currently the flair we have available is for professional bakers/chefs, amateur bakers, or Mods. If you'd like a flair assigned, please shoot us a Mod-mail with verification of your qualifications and we'll assign a flair immediately. Professionals, we simply ask for some proof (culinary degree, etc). Amateur bakers is a bit of a wide-target so for this we're looking specifically at individuals who didn't attend culinary school or pastry school but own/operate a small business or work as a baker in some capacity outside of their home kitchens. Again, proof is necessary of your credentials, and we're always open to adding new flairs.

# Closing

Of course this is all trial and error, so if something isn't working it's subject to change. If something is working but needs tweaking, we'll be handling that too. We are always open to suggestions on improvements, and constructive criticisms from others. Our Mod-Mail is always open.
