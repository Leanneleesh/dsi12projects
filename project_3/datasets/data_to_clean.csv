1,I hate my own cooking,"I have been learning how to cook over the past year. people tell me I have gotten pretty good at it. my fiance' is super appreciative and loves everything i cook. problem is, i hate everything i cook. i find it repulsive. it could be the best tasting thing i've ever made, and i'd have no interest in it. it's starting to depress me, because i spend so much time and money on these dishes that my fiance' will eat from for days, and all i can do is watch him eat it. when i finally go out of my mind from hunger, ill just go to McDonalds and eat chicken nuggets. if my mom or someone else makes food, i'll usually enjoy it. i just can't seem to get past this psychological barrier and i've never been more unhealthy and hungry in my life.

2,Skip the fancy apron trend and get yer'self a welding apron,"Want that hip, macho aesthetic in the kitchen that's all the rage right now? Well, rather than breaking the bank on a waxed canvas or leather apron try on a welding apron.

I was raised by welders, and I wouldn't be caught searing a bone-in steak, or tending to a grill without the apron my grandpa used to protect him from molten metal flying at his delicates. These aprons are meant to be ridden hard and put away wet; the one I use regularly is probably twice my age, and shows many signs of angle-grinders and flying metal that tried to cut my grandfather short, AND I think it would still protect me if I ever decided to explore the various circles of hell.

3,My mom's measuring cup,"Maybe this is about cooking. Maybe not. Since cooking is such a personal emotional thing for many of us I'll take the risk. Let me know if this doesn't belong here.

I have said the final farewell to all of my grandparents and my parents. When they died we all sorted through their belongings and chose a few things to keep. Most of my selections were from the kitchen. My mom's mom provided a pastry blender. My dad's mom a little screen sieve. My mom provided a few items, the most special to me is a little aluminum measuring cup that she always had in the flour canister. Lots of memories came along for the ride with that measuring cup. It is now in my flour canister and I think of her every time I use it. It is still usually painful nearly three years later but I will always keep it in the canister. Tonight it was eggplant parmesan and the breading needed some flour. I both hate and cherish using it and am missing her a lot right now. I wish I could post a photo of that simple measuring cup in this text only sub; you'll just have to imagine it.

If there's a point to this post I suppose it is to encourage everyone to cherish and make time for the important things in life with people and cooking being at the top of the list.

EDIT I totally forgot about imgur. Thx for the reminder u/drunky_crowette.

Here's a link to a pic of the aforementioned measuring cup:  https://imgur.com/gallery/4Tqq5De

EDIT2 it seems cliche but I really did not expect such a big response to this post. I have two general comments. First, there must have been a really successful ad campaign mamy decades ago that persuaded the mothers of the day to use this specific cup for flour. I can't believe how many commenters have stated they have the exact same cup in their flour. Second, I suppose awards and karma are nice, but what is most meaningful to me is how this post has connected so deeply with so many people and in some cases helped them move forward a bit in their grieving process.

Spicy Salmon Burritos

Ingredients:
1 lb Atlantic salmon (or salmon of choice)
Tortilla of choice
Jezebel spicy spice seasoning
Olive oil
Pico de Gallo:
3 Roma tomatoes
1/4 white onion
1/8 bunch cilantro
1 jalapeño de seeded
1/2 lime
Adobo sauce:
1/4 cup sour cream
7 oz can La Costena Chipotles in adobo sauce
Salt

Recipe:

5. Lightly coat salmon in olive oil, and coat lightly on both sides with the jezebel spicy spice rub.
6. Grill salmon for about 5-7 mins each side on high heat per inch of thickness, or until salmon reaches internal temperature of 145F and flakes easily with a fork. If baking, preheat oven to 450F and bake for approximately 12-15 mins. 
7. Place salmon in a small bowl and break up into shreds/small pieces with a fork, ensuring that seasoning from salmon is mixed throughout.
8. Remove adobo/sour cream sauce and Pico de Gallo 
from the fridge, and heat tortillas on stove or in microwave.
9. Place tortilla on plate, add salmon, then Pico de Gallo, and adobo/sour cream sauce to finish. Wrap ingredients in tortilla.

15,DAE have a mystery spice blend?,"About 5 or 6 years ago, I made some lamb rogan josh and ended up with far too much leftover spice rub. I didn't want to throw it all away, so I stuck it in a ziploc and labelled it. The problem is, rogan josh is not something I make often, so it sat there for a while until I started incorporating it in other dishes. Over the years, I've dipped into it and added things back in so often that I have zero idea of what is in there anymore, but it is many generations past anything resembling rogan josh.

I started doing this for convenience and thriftiness, but I feel like it has helped me become a better chef (even if the practice isn't very chef-like). Every time I'm considering using it, I'll smell the bag and try to figure out what's in it, and decide whether it will complement my dish or if I should add any leftover seasoning into it.

21,Why didn't your parents teach you to cook?,"Neither my mother nor my father taught me to cook.  I visit many people's homes for work and there's no learning to cook going on there either.

I see this phenomenon across different cultures to varying degrees. I see it in Chinese culture. I see it in British culture. It seems almost universal that you get to university and start living off ramen and mac and cheese!

What a disaster! Was it always this way? 

I've heard explanations like it's easier to eat out &amp; it's easier to order pre-prepared packaged food when you're busy. I'm sure that's a factor but I'm starting to think that this isn't actually the main reason. I wondered if maybe the main reason why cooking isn't taught is actually part of a much bigger thing where education is outsourced to school. I also think the lack of community across the world is to blame because when I lived in close hippy communities we swapped ideas from our cultures on how to do things.

With some input from r/Cooking on another thread, I put together something that's every bit as tasty is as the most complicated, most expensive, most foreign, most foofy, extended pinkie homemade mac-n-cheese known.

* I chose the store brand ""extra creamy"" version.  It's better than Kraft, it requires twice as much milk, and it's elbow macaroni so there is no instant giveaway.
* I substituted heavy whipping cream for the milk.
* I seasoned the pasta water with salt -- a lot of salt, even though it didn't say to.
* When combining the just-cooked pasta and cheese dust, I seasoned fairly liberally with Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning (6 ounce shakers are $1.00 at the Dollar Store), freshly ground black pepper and MSG.
* I put it under the salamander for about a minute before placing the pan on the line to give it just a hint of a crust.

Am I just weird? Are there other people that just can't stand the taste? Did I just buy the wrong kind of tofu? 

I tried different cooking methods, I've fried it in oil, I've pan fried it, I've baked it, I marinated it with different things, and I was actually really impressed by how much you can change the texture and how much flavour you can pack in there, but the 'tofu taste' that J hatte still remained.",t3_eshp7z,TotalStatisticNoob,1

I don't want to rely on recipes so damn much so was wondering if I just wing it, if anyone had a good starting point for a simple crumble/dough. I was just gonna use a bit of butter, flour, salt, sugar, egg and cinnamon, but the proportions I am unsure of especially as I am just making a small batch. Was thinking it would be kind of cool to fold the dough a lot sort of like a puff pastry, or perhaps filo. I see some recipes call for pre bought filo or puff pastry so it's obviously not a new concept or anything... is there a name for that dish? Perhaps fold several smaller sections of dough and then layer those together. Beats me.

Apple wise was just gonna go half granny smith half braeburn... I think last I did it I just mixed diced apples with some melted butter, cinnamon, maybe a touch of lemon iirc? That sound about right? Maybe the butter was only in the dough... I forget. And was thinking of maybe switching things up and very briefly sauteeing the apples in butter before putting them in the loaf pan and adding the topping but that is probably redundant.

42,Please make sure to keep salt/baking soda on hand while you fry,"Tonight, I was making homemade fries. They always end up super delicious and I even made my own fry sauce! But not without creating two grease fires first. 

I will admit blame, I put in a little too much oil and didn’t get as much water out of the potatoes as I should have. About 30 mins in, my pot boils over and bam. Grease fire number one. I threw baking soda on it, and within 30 seconds, it was out. Crisis averted. I poured the oil into another pot, over the sink, and moved to a different burner. 

As luck would have it, about 15 mins later, I accidentally put in too many fries and before I could respond, the pot boiled over...again. This one was a lot worse. I’d used all my baking soda so I grabbed my container of salt and started throwing it onto and underneath the burner. It took closer to a minute and a half for everything the fizzle out. My pots are charred, but my potatoes are tasty and my apartment isn’t burned to the ground

So moral of the story: always have salt/baking soda with you when you fry things. Do not use water, and do not fan the flames out because that will make it worse. Fires like this can happen to anyone and things can go wrong quickly. So learn from me and don’t be a dumbass twice in a row. 

Second moral: always double fry your fries. They turn out so good.

EDIT: third moral: as a wonderful commenter pointed out, obviously try your best not to start a fire in the first place. But if you do, make sure you know how to put one out BEFORE it happens",t3_esmvb6,mediocrewingedliner,1

I would love to give the Japanese culture as much accuracy as I can as well, but I have much less experience with Japan and its culture.

We have a large low coffee table and I figure i can get us some pillows to sit on.  I ordered some chop sticks, I know they wont be able to use them, but figured it would be fun to try.   It says to use a variety of small dishes, I am a bit of a china ware horder, so that is doable.

The author of the book did not give me a simple menu, she says to just pick some of each category and chose thing with different flavors, but I really do not know what each food is going to taste like.  The menu I am going with so far is: 

Green tea, I cannot get loose leaf here

Basic Clear soup, I ordered Dashinomoto (this will be completely new) (O-sumashi)

Sesame seed dressing with Broccoli (Groma-ae)

Rice

Chicken in a Pot (Mitzutaki)  with soy sause/lemon for dipping and chives, ginger root for garnish

Anyone on here from Japan? Or of Japanese decent? Can you tell me if this is a close example of what might be ate during a nice meal with family?  Is there anything I might add (way out in the middle of no where, so it will be hard to get much but I would be happy to know for maybe next time)  My kids range from 7 to 2, but only the 7 yr is really picky, she will eat the chicken plain.

55,Tip for cooking pasta,"I've always been confused by the ""classic"" way of cooking pasta: Using lots of water, making it as salty as the sea, and then setting a bit of cooking water aside for adding it to the sauce. For me it made no sense. So I came up with my own way of cooking pasta. 

1) Using far less water. All noodles have to be covered of course, but adding a lot more has no benefits. They won't stick together if you stir from time to time. By using less water, you get a higher concentration of starches.

2) Not salting the water for the first 5 minutes (that is, if you use normal noodles with a cooking time of about 10 min) and reserving some of the UNSALTED pasta water. 5 min are enough for the salt to penetrate the noodles, you won't taste any difference. 

3) Adding most of the unsalted pasta water before and letting it further reduce in the sauce; this again increases the starch concentration. Still don't use all of your reserved water so you can regulate the consistency of the pasta with the sauce later, dry pasta is BAD.",t3_esife8,TotalStatisticNoob,1

On both my attempts, I start with 20gr water 20gr flour on day one, discard about half and add 40gr water and 40gr flour on day two, and keep adding about 1tbsp flour and water every morning


The first one fails after about day 5, with about 3ml layer of hooch, smells bad (vomit inducing) , and almost no sign of bubbling. Granted I didn't know it was hooch and that you need to discard it. I threw attempt one since I can't revive it. 

My current batch (attempt two): on day one there's a little bit of clear water layer after 12h.I just stir it back in. On day two, about 6h after feeding it triples in size! On day three, I notice it looks like it's not active. when I open the jar, I can feel the air rising up to be quite warm, which I thought must be normal. There's a little bit hooch, and it smells like acetone (which worries me) . I discard the hooch and the top layer of the starter, added 40gr flour and 40gr water, and about 6h later, there's almost no change in size, with a little bit hooch.

81,Make some potstickers for Chinese New Year. :),"Chinese New Year is coming up.  What better way to celebrate than to cook and eat with family and friends.

I called up my mom and asked her for the recipe.

Dumplings

* 1 lb of ground pork
* 1 cup of cabbage (not nappa) diced
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 clove or garlic (minced)
* 6 scallions (whites cut up)
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 2 TBSP soy sauce
* 1 tsp Chinese cooking wine
* 1 package of round dumpling wrappers (about 35-45 per package)

Dipping Sauce

* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup Chinese Chinkiang black vinegar
* 1 tsp ginger (cut 2 thin slices into very thin strips)

&amp;#x200B;

Chop up the cabbage and put in a big bowl and mix in the salt.  Let it sit and wilt a bit.  My mom said that this makes it softer for mixing. Let it sit while you prep the other ingredients.

Combine the ingredients for the dipping sauce.  The ginger will infuse the sauce nicely. :)

Mix pork, cabbage, garlic, scallions, sesame oil, 2 TBSP soy sauce, cooking wine in a bowl until well combined.  Make a small meat pancake and fry it in a skillet.  Taste test and adjust seasonings.

Now it's time to wrap. Use about a rounded teaspoon of filling per wrapper. (YouTube has some really good videos).

To cook the dumplings:. Add about a 1/2 TBSP canola oil to a non-stick pan. Add the dumplings, one by one into the pan...make sure to rub some of the oil in the pan onto the bottom of each dumpling.  Add about 3 TBSP of water.  Cook, covered, on med to low heat for about 7 - 9minutes.  (I usually like to use lower heat in my cooking so that I don't burn my foods.)  Check to see that the dumpling skins look steamed through.  If not steamed through, and the pan is dry, add another TBSP of water.

Once the dumplings look steamed through, take the cover off and turn up the heat a little to crips the bottoms.

Plate the dumplings on a big plate and serve with the ginger dipping sauce.

Enjoy!

Happy Chinese New Year!  May the new year bring you health, prosperity and happiness.",t3_es7yko,milesmeow,1
82,My love letter to pantry pastas,"I feel like we get a lot of questions about what to keep on hand in your pantry/fridge so I wanted to share six of my go-to pasta sauces (plus a couple more that I don't like but maybe you will) which can all be made with 11 ingredients that are really easy to keep around. All of these recipes come together in like 20 minutes and are almost impossible to mess up.

#The Ingredients

1. **Whole peeled canned tomatoes.** The best tomatoes are generally what end up whole in the cans plus they don't have any firming agents that can keep them from cooking down nicely. imo no point in springing for San Marzano most of the time. I'd recommend Muir Glenn in the US or Mutti in Europe. Keep a few cans around always—obviously they're not going bad anytime soon.
2. **Tomato paste.** The tubes are handy if you'll be using little bits somewhat frequently. I think ATK recommends Cento for this one in the US. I use Mutti again in Europe.
3. **Garlic.** It's garlic. You know the deal. Keeps for a couple weeks at least somewhere cool and dry.
4. **Yellow onions.** Yellow onions are mildest and best for cooked applications imo, but feel free to use white or red if that's how you get your jollies. Also keeps for a couple weeks.
5. **Shallots.** Even milder than the yellow onions. In a pinch, you could use onions in all the recipes that call for shallots. Or shallots in all the recipes that call for onions if you've got that Rockefeller money *Also* keeps for a couple weeks.
6. **Lemons.** Nothing fancy needed. Just plain old lemons. If you like the zest, maybe spring for organic. They keep a week or two in the fridge.
7. **Heavy cream.** Heavy cream or heavy whipping cream both work—just make sure it's not sweetened. Generally lasts about two weeks.
8. **Parmigiano reggiano.** Get the real stuff in its whole form—no ground up shit. It can be DOP if you want but doesn't have to be. There's plenty of great parm out there that isn't DOP-certified (but none of it it sold by Kraft). I personally prefer a 24-month most of the time, but a more complex 36-month has its charms too. It'll last quite a while wrapped up in the fridge.
9. **Pecorino romano.** Another grating cheese, but quite different from parm in flavor. While parm is more about nutty umami, pecorino brings more saltiness and a hint of tang. I'm probably in the minority here, but if both cheeses were in a burning building and I could only save one, I'd save the pecorino. You *can* substitute them for each other in a pinch but, like I said, they're not all that similar.
10. **Guanciale or pancetta.** Guanciale can be challenging to find outside of Europe, but it's worth the effort to track it down. (I think you can even order it on Amazon). It's fattier, sweeter, and milder in flavor than pancetta, but pancetta is much easier to find so you can sub that if needed. You can freeze either for quite a while. Just cut into thickish slabs (roughly ¼"" or 0.5cm) and separate with wax paper then keep it in the freezer. You can cut it into lardons straight from the freezer (it's way easier that way actually) and use it without thawing.
11. **Vodka.** Alternative uses: getting you drunk. Lasts forever.

I'm also assuming that you have some real basics on hand already. Namely salt, black pepper, chili flakes, olive oil, and butter. You'll need the actual pasta too. I recommend De Cecco across the board.

#The Recipes

1. **Basic tomato sauce/arrabbiata.** (Tomatoes, garlic, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). My basic quick tomato sauce is actually based on [Serious Eat's arrabbiata recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/penne-pasta-arrabbiata-sauce-recipe.html). If you don't like spice, you can dial the pepper back as much as you like. This works with just about any shape. Penne's a classic, but casarecce might be my fave. Also great on [homemade gnocchi](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/03/technique-fresh-ricotta-gnocchi-fast.html).
2. **All'amatriciana.** (Tomatoes, onion, pecorino, guanciale/pancetta, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). This is hands down the king of pasta sauces in my book. The pork fat takes everything that's great about tomato sauce and turns it up to 11 with minimal added effort. I use Marcella Hazan's recipe, which you can find [here](https://cookingfrombooks.com/2014/05/12/pasta-allamatriciana-2/). The only alteration I make is I render and crisp the pork first (starting in a cold pan) and *then* add the onions. idk why Marcella never seems to brown meat. Bucatini is supposedly the classic with this, but in Italy I've seen it much more with mezze maniche and I prefer it that way. That's a tough shape to find though, so you can sub something like rigatoni.
3. **Alla gricia.** (Pecorino, guanciale, black pepper, olive oil). Alla gricia is basically the midway point between all'amatriciana and cacio e pepe. Once again, I think the pork really improves on cacio e pepe. While it's fine to sub pancetta in the last recipe, I think this one suffers a bit more from the substitution. I recommend the [Serious Eats recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/11/pasta-alla-gricia.html). As with all'amatriciana, mezze maniche or rigatoni is the move.
4. **Cacio e pepe.** (Pecorino, black pepper, olive oil, butter). Is it as good as alla gricia? Despite being much more well-known, I'd say no. But sometimes you can't find guanciale or just can't be assed to render it. Cacio e pepe to the rescue. Once again, [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/spaghetti-cacio-e-pepe-recipe.html). Keep in mind that legit pecorino is very salty, so don't oversalt the pasta water. If all pecorino is too much for you, experiment with using part parm. Spaghetti is the way to go for this one.
5. **Alla vodka.** (Tomato paste, shallot, heavy cream, parmesan, vodka, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). Somehow this sauce hits all the exact same comforting notes as boxed mac and cheese (I mean that in the best way possible). I really like the [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/fusilli-alla-vodka-basil-parmesan) recipe. Fusilli is awesome with this, but the classic penne also works.
6. **Al limone.** (Garlic, shallot, lemon, heavy cream, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). A break from the tomato-y cheesy porkiness. This is one of my favorites. I use the [Cooks Illustrated recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/videos/1731-spaghetti-with-lemon-and-olive-oil-al-limone) (non-video is paywalled) but add some garlic, chili flake, and a bunch more lemon juice. I skip the zest and herbage. Use spaghetti for this one.

Finally, a couple honorable mentions: you also have all the ingredients here for **aglio e olio** and **alfredo**. I don't personally like either all that much, but I know lots of people go gaga over aglio e olio especially. Try 'em out if they sound up your alley. If you keep eggs around, you could also do **carbonara.** Again, not my fave, but you do you.",t3_ermku7,elijha,1

88,HELP! 2 months to learn how to cook impressively.,"Hi Reddit! This is my first post on this sub but I need help from you guys who actually know how to cook well.
I'm from the UK and my partner from South Korea is coming over for the first time in 2 months for a few weeks. If you guys didnt know it's VERY expensive in South Korea to buy fresh ingredients such as meat, vegetables and dairy and there's little chance to try non-Koreanified Western food. My partner is very excited to come over to the UK so that we can cook fresh meals together to save some money for other travels (The UK is quite cheap for groceries). He knows I'm still learning how to cook and I have a few basic dishes I can whip up and some of my other cooking I'd eat myself but I don't feel confident cooking for other people.
I want to surprise him and learn some new recipes before he comes! Preferably Western cuisine he can't get over there (although pretty much anything non East Asian would be fine). I also just need to learn to cook in general.
I'd really appreciate some advice on cooking for a noob like me and some recommendations for easy and impressive recipes and some kitchen basics eg what essential spices would you recommend me to have? (Where I live we have standard British supermarkets, Eastern European markets, Chinese markets and a Middle Eastern supermarket). If you were having Western food for the first time what would you want to try?

But I've slightly charred the soup part of a big batch of chicken and dumplings (fried my alliums to the bottom while cooking the dumplings-d'oh!) Thankfully I was cooking the dumplings in the broth first to store separately, so the veggies and chicken are unaffected. 


My question is this: is there any way to save the broth? It only tastes slightly charred, it's not strong at all but it is noticeable. I'm ideally looking for something I can add that will hide the burned flavor while still tasting like a proper thick chicken soup.",t3_es7mnh,chillChillnChnchilla,1
96,How would you blow $400 on kitchen equipment?,"I'm looking for inspiration! All my family and friends know I enjoy cooking (and especially baking), so for Christmas and birthdays I often get gift cards to my local kitchenware shop. Grateful as I am, the problem is I'm now at the point where my kitchen is pretty well stocked, so I'm running out of ideas and the gifts cards are accumulating faster than I can spend them.

It's a good opportunity to replace my cheap electric hand mixer with a fancy one (KitchenAid maybe), and I'd still have a fair amount left over for some fun stuff. Or I could spend it all on something cool and expensive, but I've already got the obvious big-ticket items, like a stand mixer, casserole dish, etc.

So let's get super indulgent: how would you spend big money at the kitchen shop? Would you get into making your own cheese or ice cream? Upgrade all the old utensils? Get yet another gorgeous bundt pan or serving platter? Le Creuset oven mitts? A few grams of saffron or powdered vanilla? Bring me your ideas!",t3_es1yw3,LateralPlanet,1
97,Shiitake Mushroom Discovery,"If anyone is having second thoughts about weird looking fungus, let me settle your doubts. Having come from a poorer upbringing with unhealthy parents, I've been closed off to the world of vegetables that are not frozen peas/carrots/potatoes. Since moving out a few years ago, I've been eating significantly better and exploring what's out there slowly. Let me tell you what, I bought Shiittake mushrooms the other day and had an eye opening experience I will never forget.

I cooked them in olive oil, garlic and balsamic vinegar and thought I was in heaven. I meant to post a picture but I ate them too fast. If anyone has other recommendations as far as recipes with them, I would love to know. They're going to be on my grocery list forever.",t3_es5dtc,missmolly9348,1
98,Seeking advice on seasoning,"I was looking for a dish that would be extremely cost effective without being tasteless and decided black beans and brown rice with some seasoning would fit the bill. I referenced a recipe online for seasoning ideas, calling for 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of chili powder, and 1/4 tsp of both salt and pepper to be added to 2 cups of beans just a little before they were done cooking. After the beans were done cooking, I put 2 cups of brown rice in with the beans, seasoned it the same as I had for the beans (the reference recipe I had used was only for seasoning the beans so I thought I'd add more to help the rice as well) and cooked the rice. When I went to taste it, everything was cooked perfectly fine, the beans and rice both tender, but it was incredibly bland. 

I ended up doubling the total amount of the seasonings little by little trying to get any semblance of taste out of the mix before I made a hail-Mary at fixing it and added about 1 tsp of garlic powder and 2 tsp of seasoning salt. I normally avoid using this particular seasoning salt because it seems to very easily overpower anything else it is with, but it did give the mix a fair bit of flavor and make it at least edible.

So the advice I wanted to seek out here would be

1. Is there any particular reason the cumin and chili powder would make no profile of their own in this? Far too little seasoning used? Or maybe those two seasonings just won't add any real flavor without more than rice and beans in the dish?
2. What seasonings would any of you use to get the most of simple black beans and brown rice?

And if needed for clarification, I used dried black beans I had soaked for 8 hours and rinsed before cooking and I made sure to thoroughly rinse the rice beforehand to remove starch. The beans had enough leftover liquids in after they had finished cooking to get away with adding about 1/2 cup water to make sure the rice had enough water.",t3_es6ttj,CalebMini2556,1

103,"Kids, cooking and roasted veggies","I just wanted to share a couple of cooking anecdotes that really made me feel good over the weekend.

Last week, my youngest daughter (who is 13) kept talking about how she wanted to make a ""healthy meal"" for the family. So, on Friday she decided on making a stir fry using [this handy info-graphic that I show to everyone who is interested in making stir-fry.](http://imgur.com/gallery/HfWH4tt) She took chicken breast, asparagus, broccoli and baby corn and stir-fried it perfectly with the orange ginger sauce recipe. Everyone (meaning my wife, her older sister and my) thought it was really good and she was very proud of herself. I only gave a couple of cooking tips during the process, but she did all the physical work.  It was a pretty great feeling.

Fast forward to Sunday evening. We'd had a big after-church meal and my wife was at her monthly book club, so we weren't going to have any sort of family dinner. At one point in the evening, I saw the leftover broccoli and asparagus in the fridge and resolved to do something with it before it went bad. So, I just put it all on a baking sheet together, hit it with some olive oil, salt and pepper and roasted it. Now, whenever I normally cook broccoli, I always just steam it. The kiddos like that and I've never roasted it before. They've had roasted asparagus before and were luke warm on it. 

When it was done, I told them about it, left it on the counter and then went into another room. I didn't really expect them to like it, but when I came back into the kitchen a little while later - the baking sheet was empty. They'd devoured it all and were asking me to make roasted broccoli again soon. It was a pretty great feeling, knowing how much they liked that - and that it was fairly healthy.

tldr; Cooking with and for family can be pretty rewarding.",t3_erw05k,Christopher_Powell,1

2) Kale. I want to like it. I love Swiss chard, spinach, arugula, etc, but kale feels like chewing on construction paper, no matter how many times I try to like it.

3) Tuna. Now, this one is probably the one that I feel weirdest about because I love fish, and I will eat a tuna salad sandwich 7 days a week. I cannot stand rare tuna, and it used to drive my dad crazy to the point he wouldn’t cook it for me because I wanted it overcooked.

I use either corn meal or semolina on the surface before putting the pizza down on it, and to be fair, the pizza doesn't stick and there are no off flavors, but frankly I find the sticky surface to be kind of disgusting.  It's discolored and tacky.  I haven't put any oil directly on it, but the pizza dough has a bit of oil in it, and I guess that's what's leeching into the stone.

138,"Recipe: How to make Sichuan Burning Noodles (plus how to make alkaline noodles), 宜宾燃面","So I wanted to show you how to make a classic noodle dish from Yibin in the Sichuan province – burning noodles.

Now, upon seeing the words “Sichuan” and “Burning Noodles” in the same sentence, I can probably guess where your mind’s headed. Yep, these noodles are indeed pretty spicy. But no... that’s not actually why they’re called “Burning Noodles”.

The ‘burn’ in burning noodles is a translation for the character ‘ran’ (燃) – which means to light, or to ignite (e.g. the flash point of an oil is referred to as its ‘ran dian’… literally translated, ‘ignition point’). Why ‘ignition noodles’? Well, they’re got the name because… they’re not a soup noodle dish. So much not a soup noodle dish, in fact, you could theoretically take a lighter to them and the noodles would burn in front of you (note: don’t do this, waste of noodles).

Now I know that feels like a hell of a commitment to the concept of ‘not soup noodle’. But you can find this sort of explicitly not-soup noodle dish in old trading towns up and down the middle to upper reaches of the Yangtze river:

1.	[Wuhan, Hot Dry Noodles](https://i.imgur.com/c1tKXua.png).  Wuhan is the last major city right before the three gorges area of the Yangtze river (criminally under-rated food city). One of their most iconic dishes is “hot dry noodles”… the dry referring to the fact that – again – this is not a soup noodle.

2.	[Wanzhou, Zajiang Noodles.](https://i.imgur.com/D9sQGpg.png) Up the river a bit, after the three gorges area – a proper city in its own right, though technically a ‘district’ of Chongqing today. Named so because it was historically place where “a myriad rivers converge and a myriad traders gather” (万川毕汇、万商云集) – though a good chunk of Wanzhou today lies beneath 150 meters of water in the reservoir created by the three gorges dam. One of their famous noodle dishes is called ‘Zajiang Noodle’ (not to be confused with the Northern ‘Zhajiang Noodle’), which’s some dry noodles topped with meat sauce.

3.	[Chongqing, Mala Xiaomian.](https://i.imgur.com/LfYRJYl.png) Historically the focal point of trade in the Sichuan province. Their noodle dish of choice is the fiery xiaomian (‘small noodles’). While historically these noodles were always served dry, today you can find them either dry or in soup.

4.	[Yibin, Burning Noodles.](https://i.imgur.com/7wrLyXO.png) Yibin lies at the Yangtze’s highest navigable point – at the intersection of the Yangtze and the Min river (the latter going up to Leshan – home of the Leshan Giant Buddha – and Chengdu). 

So. Why do all of these places have dry noodles? Even though these cities span three different provinces, they were all *so* influenced by the Yangtze river trade that there’s this… similarity to the cultures there that’s hard to put into words. They’ve all got this… ineffable toughness to them, and these river towns were some of the first in the country to use chili pepper extensively. Some people say that dry noodles were originally popular on the docks because, well, rocky boats aren’t exactly the best place to scarf down a soup noodle. Or perhaps it’s a climate thing. Or maybe, I dunno, they just liked their noodles sans soup for the same reason people in the West generally eat noodles dry – they just… liked them better sometimes. I dunno.

Now of course, this is one of those classic street food sort of dishes, which means its paradoxically (A) simple to serve but (B) time consuming to prep. The way I’d personally sort this logistically would be to sort all of your ingredients in advance (on the weekend or something) and toss them in the fridge. Then the remaining cook time is like… five minutes of work max, so it makes for a great quick snack or an easy dinner, that kind of thing.

So I’ll be splitting this up into three sections. First, ‘stuff to prep in advance’. Second, ‘how to make noodles’ (just in case you’re feeling a Sichuan noodle making project… any sort of alkaline noodle should work ok though). Then lastly, ‘how to make a bowl of burning noodles’. Apologies if this gets confusing – I just was wracking my brain trying to figure out the best way to organize this all so that we could all stay true to the essence of this dish (a quick meal) while still staying true to the flavor.

[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/A1y-OhS9z20). I go off on the history a touch again in the beginning there, so jump in at ~ the two minute mark if you want just the recipe.

## Things to prepare in advance for Burning Noodles

Ok, so there’s either three or four things that I think would be convenient to prepare in advance:

* An Yibin-style chili oil called ‘xiangyou’.

* Toasted crushed peanuts.

* Toasted crushed sesame seeds.

* Toasted yacai – pickled and fermented mustard greens.

For those then, you’ll need:

1.	*Dried Sichuan Erjingtiao chilis (二荆条) -or- Arbols, 20g; Dried Heaven Facing Chili (朝天椒) -or- Thai Birds Eye, 10g; or sub in ~1/3 cup of a good chili powder.* So traditionally the chili oil is made with a toasted chili powder – a powder made from a mix of two parts Sichuan erjingtiao chili (a chili that’s roughly as how as cayenne and is known for its vibrant red color) and one part Heaven facing chili (a… quite spicy chili that’s related to and slightly more mild than Thai bird’s eye). Arbols or cayennes are an acceptable sub for Erjingtiao (though you could perhaps add a pinch of Korean chili powder for color if its convenient), Thai bird’s eye is a very close sub for Heaven facing (though Thai bird’s eye *is* hotter, fair warning).

2.	*Sichuan caiziyou (菜籽油) -or- Indian mustard seed oil -or- Peanut oil (花生油), 60g.* So right – like all oil-heavy dishes in the Chinese southwest, Yibin xiangyou relies on a virgin rapeseed oil called Caiziyou. It’s… really really hard to come by in the West (though there’s been some sightings in NYC, and it looks like Mala Market – an online Sichuan ingredient shop – might be getting some in soon). I bring it up not to tease you, but because it’s a foundational flavor. After testing a number of different oils, I found Indian mustard seed oil to be almost indistinguishable after heating it up… close enough to be a direct sub. That said, I know Indian mustard seed oil *also* isn’t exactly a supermarket staple in the West… so barring that, just use peanut oil. Not perfect, but should still taste good.

3.	*Lard (猪油) -or- cooked peanut oil (花生油), 60g.* So after making the chili oil, we’ll be mixing in a good chunk of melted lard. That said, this *is* one of those almost-veg dishes, so if you’re cooking for vegetarians… feel free to swap in cooked peanut oil instead. Basically just heat the peanut oil up til smoke point like we do in the recipe below, **cool it down a bit** and reserve (note: add the peanut oil at, let's say... 80C give or take). Not as authentic as lard, but should still be real nice in the dish. 

4.	*Spices/seasonings for the chili oil: 25g smashed ginger (姜), one whole walnut (带壳核桃), ½ cinnamon stick (桂皮), 2 star anise (八角), 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorn (花椒).* Yep, that one whole walnut – shell and all. Lends a nice earthiness to the chili oil… a real classic in Yibin xiangyou.

5.	 *Peanuts (生花生), 5 tbsp.* We’ll be toasting these, then crushing them. If you’d like, feel free to swap for an equal amount of roasted peanuts in order to skip the toasting process.

6.	*Sesame seeds (白芝麻), 1.5 tbsp.*  We’ll also be toasting and crushing these as well.

7.	*Yacai (芽菜), ~1/2 cup.* So right. The bane of many people in the West attempting to recreate Sichuan dishes – yacai (pickled and fermented mustard greens) is a non-negotiable must here. While not all Asian supermarkets carry it, the good ones do – and [it’s always available extremely overpriced online](https://www.amazon.com/Bin-Sui-Cai-SuiMiYaCai-Vegetable/dp/B01N7T7M4X).

Note that all of these amounts’ll be enough for 4-5 bowls of noodles. Feel free to scale these up if you’d like.

*Process: Chili oil, nuts, and yacai prep:*

Let’s just start with the chili oil because it’s the most intensive. For the chili oil:

1.	*If working from dried chilis, toast for ~5 minutes over medium-low flame.* The chilis’ll be done once they’ve deepened in color and started to smell real nice. As always with toasting chilis though, it’s safer to under toast than over toast.

2.	*Snip the chilis into 2cm sections, keeping the seeds but tossing the stems.*

3.	*Pulse for ~6 minutes in a blender until the chilis are rather fine flakes. Reserve.* You’re looking for a pretty ‘powdery’ chili flake – [something like this](https://i.imgur.com/uepeCo8.png).

4.	*Heat up your 60g of caiziyou (or mustard seed oil, or peanut oil) until it begins to smoke, ~230C. Keep it at that temperature for about 1-2 minutes, then shut off the heat.* Yeah, that’s not a typo – 230C. Heating the oil like this is a must for both Sichuan caiziyou *and* Indian mustard seed oil – doing so’ll significantly reduce the pungency of the oil. Makes peanut oil taste pretty good, too.

5.	*Let the oil cool down to 200-210C, then add in the ginger, the walnut, the Sichuan peppercorn, the cinnamon, and the star anise. Cook for ~5 minutes.* Adding this stuff’ll lower the temperature – not a problem, we’re looking for this to slowly cook at around 150C. If the temperature dips too far below 150C (likely), swap the heat back on to roughly cook at that temperature. It’s fine if it’s a bit variable, but you **do** need it to be at ~150 before the next step.

6.	*Take out some of the clunkier spices, then strain the oil into the chili flakes.* It’ll sizzle in a real satisfying way. Quick stir.

7.	*Melt the lard, then pour it in with the chili oil.* Another quick stir.

And… there you have it. Reserve that stuff, it’s good to use for the burning noodles.

As for everything else?

1.	*Toasted the peanuts over a medium flame for ~12 minutes.* Toast until the peanuts are cooked through and charred on the outside.

2.	*Rub the peanuts with your fingers, then lightly blow off the peels.* Or peel however you feels like, but blowing the peels off is a lot easier than going one by one.

3.	*Put the toasted peanuts in a bag, and light roll over them with a rolling pin or a 24oz beer bottle for ~2 minutes.* A beer bottle is super classic for this lol. Regardless, you want something [about this consistency](https://i.imgur.com/4UVdtSW.png). (Sorry for the blurry pic there)

4.	*Toast the sesame seeds over a medium-low flame for about five minutes.* Or until the sesame seeds start to darken and/or you can hear a couple popping.

5.	*In a mortar -or- with a bag/beer bottle, ever so lightly crush the sesame to get them to release their oil.* Some that [looks about like this](https://i.imgur.com/DghOB5W.png). 

6.	*Soak the yacai in cool water for ~5 minutes.* Doing this will get out their salinity.

7.	*Toast the yacai over a medium-low flame for 1-2 minutes.* Or until dry and just barely beginning to stick to the wok.

Note that we actually didn’t toast our yacai because we… prefer it untoasted. It’s a little sharper and funkier that way. The more proper way is to toast though, so… do that.

## How to Make Sichuan-style Alkaline Noodles

Ok, so again. This is not a must or anything. Want to sub in Japanese ramen noodles? Sure, go for it. But really… any noodle that has a nice bite to it should work fine. Want to use dried spaghetti? I mean… it wouldn’t be the same for sure, but it could still be tasty. Just be sure to cook al dente, and never tell a soul I said it was ok. 

But I do think it’s nice to undertake a noodle project every now and then – if only to help understand what you’re going for, and to guide more informed shopping choices in the future.

It’s also pretty easy in the grand scheme of things. And we’ll be using a pasta maker and a stand mixer to make our life even easier.

*Ingredients, Sichuan-style alkaline noodles:*

1.	*Bread flour -or- Chinese noodle flour (高筋面粉), 300g.* Basically anything with a higher gluten content – we were working with something that was 12.8% protein IIRC.

2.	*Water, 125g.* Or I guess 126 to be exact – we were going with 42% hydration. Note that this’ll make for a really dry dough… and some recipes go even drier than that (we actually saw one that was 38% hydration). 

3.	*Sodium carbonate (碱面), ½ tsp.* So yeah – that’s sodium carbonate, *not* sodium bicarbonate (i.e. baking soda). It’s a much stronger base… sporting a pH of ~11.5 to baking soda’s ~8.5. It’s readily available online, and feel free to sub in Jianshui/Kan Sui/Lye water if that’s more convenient. All of the above inconvenient? Feel free to use the baked baking soda trick – I’ll detail how in the notes below.

*Process, Sichuan style alkaline noodles:*

1.	*Dissolve the sodium carbonate in with the water.* Mix well.

2.	*Slowly add the water/sodium carbonate mixture into the flour, mixing it in bit by bit.* Especially because this’s a pretty dry dough, so doing it bit by bit helps the flour absorb the water more evenly. Aim for the dry parts when tossing in the water. I like mixing in with a single chopstick – less sticky that way.

3.	*Knead for ~8 minutes -or- use a stand mixer with the hook attachment on speed two.* Same ~8 minutes. Especially with the hook attachment, you might find the dough to still be a bit crumbly after eight minutes – no problem at all, just press and knead it together by hand until it all comes together. It’ll still be a bit craggly – no worries. 

4.	*Cover, let it rest for ~30 minutes.*

5.	*Cut the dough in half, then roll it into something that looks vaguely ‘sheet-ish’.* We’ll be working this one half at a time. Rolling it’s just to get it to squeeze into the pasta maker easier.

6.	*Flour the dough and pasta maker, then pass it through at the largest setting. Then do the same at the third smallest setting.*

7.	*Fold the dough ~four times, then slice it with a knife to make noodles.* So two choices here – machine cut or knife cut noodles. If you want your pasta maker to cut them, just uh… cut them. We’re looking for noodles that’re about 2mm wide. You can also cut them by hand too, of course – there’s something about the texture of knife cut noodles that I seem to prefer, but it’s hard to pinpoint what exactly. Either way, you want something that looks [more or less like this](https://i.imgur.com/ktSUbSr.png).

8.	*Pull apart and thoroughly flour the noodles.* Add more flour than you think you might need when flouring them – nothing’s worse than making a bunch of noodles, only to have them end up as one sticky mass.


In an ideal world, eat… soon. But I’ve found these are still quite good even 48-72 hours later too.

## Putting together our Burning Noodles

So in Yibin, in most of the noodle shops you have one of two choices: 100g of noodles (二两) or 150g of noodles (三两). We’ll be assuming a 150g bowl of noodles, mostly just because it feels a bit more substantive to me personally.

*Ingredients, one bowl of burning noodles:*

1.	*Fresh noodles, 150g.*

2.	*Yibin chili oil, 2 tbsp.* I.e. the chili oil from above.

3.	*Light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tsp.*

4.	*Toasted sesame oil, 1 tsp.* Actually most authentic here would be untoasted sesame oil (referred to as ‘white’ sesame oil – 白芝麻油). We used toasted out of laziness in sourcing mostly, but both work great.

5.	*Toasted -or- untoasted yacai (芽菜), 2 tbsp.* So yeah, we actually preferred ours untoasted here. But toasted yacai is more proper, so let that be your default choice.

6.	*Mixed toasted crushed peanuts/sesame, 2 tbsp.*

7.	*Sliced scallion greens (葱), ~2 tbsp.*

8.	*MSG (味精), ¼ tsp -or- chicken bouillon powder (鸡粉), ½ tsp.* Either way – chicken bouillon powder’s basically MSG (well actually usually a mix of disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate given how hyperbolic some Westerns are of MSG) plus some other stuff anyhow. You find see both in Yibin.  

*Process, Burning Noodles:*

Ok, quick aside on equipment. One super classic thing that you’ll see in Yibin are [these things](https://i.imgur.com/tfaiuKs.png) – basically, vendors’ll toss the noodles in after cooking and vigorously strain them in a snapping circular motion. You certainly don’t need to be that obsessive – just do a bang up job straining them. That said, if something conical like a chinois is handy, why not? Just toss the noodles in and snap strain like the vendors do. Plus, you feel all cool doing it.

You don’t want too much time in between straining and doing the initial mix with the liquid ingredients (like, ~60 seconds max), so be sure to have everything handy.

1.	*Cook the noodles until -just- past al dente, ~1 minute.* I usually just time this kind of thing by trying it and seeing what the texture’s like… it ended up being ~1 minute for the fresh alkaline noodles we made above. But don’t take my word for it – if you’re working with a package, go with the package… and even if you’re using the same fresh noodle recipe above, it’s possible that you couldn’t cut your noodles a little thinner or a little thicker. So yeah. Taste the noodles.

2.	*Thoroughly strain the noodes.* It’s really tough to describe this motion… basically you barely lift the strainer up above your shoulder, then snap it down to your waist. Do this 4-5 times and the noodles should be pretty dry. Or alternatively, strain however the hell you feel like – just make sure to move fast so they’re not clumping/sticking on you. 

3.	*Add the liquid ingredients: the chili oil, the soy sauce, the sesame oil.* Give it a thorough mix.

4.	*Top with the rest of the ingredients, then serve.* Mix it all up right before eating.

**Note on how to make sodium carbonate:**

So, why do we even use baking soda in baked goods and such? Well, for two reasons. First is that you can combine it with an acid like cream of tartar and make things puff up in the same way your elementary science fair volcano puffed up. 

Reason two? To make it decompose.

See, at temperatures above 80C, baking soda decomposes and forms (1) water vapor (well, water vapor over 100C of course…) (2) carbon dioxide and (3) sodium carbonate. That CO2 is what the gluten network in your pancakes traps, and what makes them light and airy. But you can take advantage of the same reaction to get your hands on some sodium carbonate, even if it’s not sold at your local supermarket.

Hat tip to Alex the French Guy cooking for this bit, his channel’s where I first heard of this. Just spread some baking soda out on a tray and bake it in a pre-heated oven at 150C for one hour. After that, jar it up and… there’s some sodium carbonate for you. Use it for this recipe, and basically anytime a recipe writer is telling you to use baking soda in order to raise pH (e.g. in Chinese velveting/marinades, the onion browning trick, de-sliming shrimp, etc etc). Sodium carbonate’ll be much stronger, so you’ll need a much smaller quantity, and it won’t alter the final taste of the dish like baking soda sometimes has the tendency to do.",t3_ercib1,mthmchris,1
139,Pepperplate Alternative,"After Pepperplate, in the last few days, decided to charge $3/month with no visible improvements I came here looking for a replacement.

Going through older posts I came across  u/julianpoy 's own recipe wonder called  [https://recipesage.com](https://recipesage.com/) and I gotta tell you, so far it is a great site/app.

Works well on desktop (Windows).  

Just downloaded the app (is it an app?) on Android and it works well also.

The transfer of my recipes from Pepperplate worked fine.  It took a few minutes (127 recipes).   

The *Scale Recipe* feature is great.  Same with the *select multiple recipes at once* feature (Put it to the test as for some reason it imported my recipes twice, possibly something I did, but it was easy to delete the doubles with this feature).

Made a change to a recipe in the phone app and the desktop version showed the updated recipe when I logged in.  

There is no fuss or ads.  It is simple and really, what else do you need?

I am excited to see how well this works for me on the next few weeks/months of using it, but my first impression is a 5/5.

140,Hand made four cheese ravioli with herb-embedded pasta,"[Here's the finished product!](https://imgur.com/KW8nMPF) I made the pasta from scratch with my new pasta roller. It was a lot of fun!

[This is the recipe I used.](https://www.prouditaliancook.com/2019/11/four-cheese-ravioli-with-herb-embedded-pasta.html?m) I pretty much followed the recipe for everything, except I added the zest of one meyer lemon, which helped cut through the richness of all the cheese. 

This recipe didn't include a topping, but I went with a classic and simple [brown butter.](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-brown-butter/) 

For the topping, I toasted up some pine nuts and gave them a rough chop. I had plenty of parsley and sage left over from the dough, so I minced those very finely. I sprinkled both on top, then added some more lemon zest and parmesan.  

This came out so, so good! For me, it was worth the effort. Once I made the dough, everything else was pretty quick to come together.

160,Help working backward to recover a classic recipe,"Oyster artichoke soup was a special part of my childhood in New Orleans. Every Christmas, the whole family would get together at my grandparents’ house. My grandfather spent all day making the soup from scratch. It was fantastic.  

After my grandfather died, I asked my mother and her siblings for the recipe. None of them had it, but my mother had her own version that tasted exactly like my grandfather’s. However, my mom made the soup from canned and frozen ingredients.  

I have tried many, many different recipes for oyster artichoke soup, but none of them come close to this one. I would really rather make it from scratch, like my grandfather did, but I don’t have the recipe.  

My mom’s recipe follows. If any of you good folks have suggestions as to how I could deconstruct and recreate my grandfather’s recipe from this one, I’d really appreciate the help!  

&gt; 
&gt; **Oyster Artichoke Soup**  
&gt; *Ingredients:*
&gt; 
&gt; * 2 pints oysters with juice
&gt; * 5 cans artichoke quarters (remove tough parts)
&gt; * 2 bags frozen chopped onions, celery and peppers
&gt; * 4 tbsp flour
&gt; * 4 tbsp butter
&gt; * 2 cans condensed mushroom soup
&gt; * 2 cans condensed celery soup
&gt; * 2 cans condensed cheddar cheese soup
&gt; * 2 cans mushrooms, stems and pieces
&gt; 
&gt; *Directions*  
&gt; Heat the butter in a large, heavy-bottom pot. Add the flour and stir to make a blond roux. Add vegetables and cook until wilted. Add artichokes and mushrooms. Cook for about 15 minutes. Add all soups and heat through. Do not allow to come to a boil. If the mixture is too thick, add cream or half and half, a little at a time. Do not add milk, as it will curdle. Add oysters and their liquor. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve.

172,"Of all the things I've learned in life, learning how to cook is the thing I'm most grateful for.","I'm sitting here eating a really really good bowl of ramen.  It's so good.  And it reminds me of a conversation I had with a friend of mine some time ago where we both agreed that learning how to cook has been one of the greatest benefits in our respective lives.  Being able to put ingredients together and turn out something that you like, and maybe even other people like, is simply *joy.*  Not being limited to what restaurants you can find is *freedom* and I am so so grateful for having learned this skill.

If I could thank people, I'd have to thank just a whole host of chefs who have had cooking shows that I have devoured relentlessly for decades.  The first cooking show I ever remember watching as a kid was [The Frugal Gourmet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfigPIvycCc) (Jeff Smith) on PBS.  After that Food Network took off and I definitely ate up Emeril, Alton Brown, Mario Batali and others.  On the internet I continue to follow Chef John at Food Wishes,  Adam Ragusea, Alex at French Guy Cooking and all the wonderful folks over at the Bon Apetit Test Kitchen.  Without all of these inspirations in my life, I'd still be eating macaroni and cheese out of a box probably.

Anyway, if you're unsure, just starting out, have no idea what you're doing or are afraid of 'screwing up' in the kitchen, I have to say: just do it.  Just keep cooking, screw things up, learn from your mistakes.  It's so rewarding in the end, I promise.

As for my ramen, this is what I do to make it fantastic:

1) Throw away that stupid packet of 'flavor' they put in there.  It's worthless.  Get yourself some Better Than Bullion in whatever flavor you like (there are several).  It's infinitely superior.

2)  Sear off some chicken breasts and finish them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes or so.

3) stir fry some veggies and just put them in a bowl to wait for now.  I use carrots, broccoli and onions.

4) On top of those veggies in that bowl, put the following: soy sauce (amount to taste), sriracha (ditto), fresh garlic, and freshly grated ginger.  All of this can sit for a few minutes marinating it's fine.

5) Use the pasta water to dissolve the bullion and just dump all of that over your noodles and veggies.  The broth will form instantly and take on a deep, rich color and you'll be able to smell that ginger throughout the house.  It's wonderful.

6) Top with chicken breasts, cut on the bias.  Finish with some cilantro or scallion or even a couple soft boiled eggs if you want.

Obviously this isn't a complicated recipe or particularly inventive, but it's just great and something I would never have dreamed of doing before I really got into cooking.

174,I made a better-than-expected brunch with goose and wanted to share!,"I apologize if this isn't super appropriate for the sub. I read the rules and thought I fit in them, I can delete if not. 

I went hunting with a buddy this weekend and shot a snow goose, and decided to just throw a brunch skillet together. It came out WAY better than I expected and I wanted to share with y'all. Detailed recipe below, but first, Imgur link to the finished tastiness:

https://imgur.com/gallery/QP1bq0k

Okay so recipe-ish. I don't cook with specific measurements all the time, I just kind of feel it out most of the time.

1) The night before your brunch, clean your goose breast fillets (I just used one for this one shared meal). Combine goose breasts in a plastic bag with 1/3 measure each of: Sriracha, Worcestershire sauce, and Sweet Chili Sauce (I used Frank's Kickin' Garlic Sauce in a substitution), where the marinade mixture just covers the goose in the bag. Cool and let it marinate over night (you don't have to do it overnight, just give it an hour or more if you're in a hurry).

2) Half-ish of a bag of frozen breakfast hasbrowns (the shredded kind). I cooked those in the vegetable oil the bag suggested, and added some pepper and garlic seasoning after they'd cooked a bit and I was stirring for the first time. Finish them and set them to the side.

3) Heat a cast iron skillet with a small amount (maybe 2TBSP tops) of Grapeseed Oil on high, until just before your oil smokes. Sear your goose breast to preference. I like my wild game cooked to rare/medium rare if it's able to be safely consumed that way, so I really just did 2.5 minutes on each side, and left it in the hot skillet while I tidied my workspace a bit. I discarded the used marinade, but if you wanted you could heat it up on the stove to a boil and reduce it to make a nice spicy glaze during this time.

4) Remove your goose breast from the skillet, put it on a cutting board to rest. Add the hash brown potatoes to the cast iron and use a spoon or spatula to stir them in the leftover stuck on stuff, oil, and juices from your searing.

5) In a separate pan, put about 2TBSP of butter to melt on medium, then fry two eggs over easy, adding a small amount of pepper and garlic powder, to taste.

6) Slice your goose to preferred thickness, lay it on the potatoes, add your eggs, and drizzle either your glaze you chose to make or sprinkle Cholula on top.

It came out way better than expected, and my buddy actually commented that ""I would never be disappointed if a fancy brunch place brought this meal to me."" 

I love wild game and this recipe actually offered very little of the game-y taste I expected, probably because of the overnight marinade. If you have any tips to offer to make it better or enhance this meal, please let me know! Thanks!

Not to mention the wine, the bay leaves, the lemon and orange zest, cinnamon stick, nutmeg and tomato paste.

And this thing simmered for about 3 hours. The result is a meat sauce that was filling, complex, and made the apartment smell amazing. 10/10 will make again.

Can be made GF (with GF breadcrumbs) or kosher for Passover (use matzah meal). If I chop the spinach small enough, I can get the kiddo to eat them without complaint. 

The only changes I would make is to hold off on the eggs until you've added the salt/pepper, so that you can add enough to taste, and that it's easier to scoop them out with a spoon, roll into a ball, gently pat down flat, and *then* put them in the pan. It's much harder to flatten them once they are in the pan. Make 1 test fritter to taste for seasoning, too. 

 [https://aggieskitchen.com/ricotta-and-spinach-fritters/](https://aggieskitchen.com/ricotta-and-spinach-fritters/) 

 

2 cups ricotta 

3 eggs, lightly whisked

3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

1 cup Panko

2 cups fresh spinach, sliced thin

a couple of good pinches of salt and pepper

6-8 tablespoons olive oil, divided, for frying (use more or less based on your preference)

 

1. Add ricotta, eggs, Parmesan cheese, panko, salt and pepper to a large bowl. Stir gently until just combined. Fold spinach into mixture.
2. Drizzle about a tablespoon or two of olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and spread around. Scoop a heaping tablespoon of ricotta and spinach mixture into hot oil and gently push down with spoon to spread and flatten just a bit, this helps them all cook up evenly. Repeat with as many spoonfuls as fit in your pan (I made 5 - 6 per batch).

Fistly I could sautee the mushroom, and fish in the same pan then deglaze it with the wine for the sauce.

I could do it in seperate pans, then de glaze each and add the two sauces together to make one or keep it seperate and have two sauces

Or I could just deglaze one pan for the sauce and ignore the other.

210,The key to high heat cooking - clarified butter,"This is something that is used constantly in professional kitchens but I never really see used in home kitchens (at least in the West). It is incredibly easy to make and store, and will absolutely transform your sauteeing/high heat cooking. 


To make it, simply add butter to a sauce pan- the size depends on how much clarified butter you want to make. I wouldn't do anything less than a pound, but I recommend you do a couple pounds - it lasts longer than whole butter because of the lack of milk solids so it won't go bad. Melt the butter down, and using a spoon, ladle off the white solids. You could either pour the butter through a fine mesh sieve with some cheese cloth to separate the butter from the solids at the bottom, or you can just ladle the butter out carefully (I recommend doing this).


To take it a step further and make ghee, simply cook the butter longer until the milk solids start to brown and the butter smells slightly nutty, and then strain.


The biggest advantage to using clarified butter is it's smoke point. It has a smoke point of around 450F (232C), which is around the same as corn and peanut oil, is higher than canola oil (400F, 205C), and much higher than extra virgin olive oil (330F, 166C) and whole butter (350F, 176C) This means you can get your pan hotter, allowing you to get harder sears on your food.


Another advantage, obviously, is flavor. I'm sure I dont need to tell you that butter tastes amazing, and is much preferable to vegetable/canola oil. You can use it exactly how you would use any other cooking oil, but some suggestions:


-Sauteeing veggies


-Eggs - great for getting a crispy over easy egg


-Use it for searing meats


-Poach shrimp in it

* lemon
* white wine

224,Caring for (and seasoning?) cast iron range grates,"For those who have cast iron grates on their stove top gas range, how do you care for them?

I ask because I have a oven/range that is only about 6 months old, and I am seeing what looks to be wearing down of the black seasoning (?) or top layer on the grates. In parts of the grate, the black color looks to be wearing off and exposing a silver layer of the grate. I think this comes from shifting pots and pans on top of the surface.

Should I be seasoning these grates like I do my cast iron pans?  If so, how should I go about that?  I should note that the grates have some little rubber feet on them so they lay softly on the surface of the range.  So I think putting them in the oven is out of the question.

Any help is appreciated!

So I kinda eye-balled the egg-to-milk ratio for the batter, are there ratio's or rules? I used a mix of corn-starch and potato starch, also eyeballing the ratio. Are there any real differences in using the two? I also see a lot of people double starching; starching directly to the dried chicken breast, egg coating, again starching. Is this suitable for oven purposes?  
I used a oven sheet and lined it with non-stick baking paper and coated it with advocado oil (was the only thing available at the moment). I don't quite understand the need to drizzle it on top of the chicken as well, would that not prevent from crisping?

&amp;#x200B;

This question is kinda of embarassing, but here it goes.

As for the context, I am 19 year old and decided that it'd really be time to pick up cooking, but I'm not really sure on where to start.

I still live at my mom's house as I'm still in school, and there's no real benefit of me moving out since it's fairly close to where my mom lives, and because of this reason I've pretty much relied on my mom's cooking until now. 

For school, I'll have to do an intern for \~4 months straight, which will be in a foreign country. This will start in late august, however, I have never really cooked apart from some eggs and simple pasta. I talked about it with my mom and she said that I could start cooking a bit for myself, and that she'd be there while I cooked to help me out and what not, but I had to come up with a list of dishes I'd like to be able to cook and whatnot.

The intern will be in Hungary, and I currently live in the Netherlands, if this matters for some reason regarding the recommendations.

252,"Questions About weird textures after marinade, (weird but good)","Hi, maybe someone knows about this, its hard to explain, there i go:

When i make my own version of kung pao chicken, I cut chicken breasts and make a marinade with soy sauce, mirim (or another acidic solution), and spices, garlic ginger and so on, nothing special, is in almost every Asian recipe and the target is to add flavor to the chicken.

After I cook it, another thing happens, it's like magic, the texture changes, and this new texture is an absolute miracle. I don't know how to describe, its more gummy, smooth, cant sense the fibers in the meat.

And my doubt always is why? why does this happens? is the soy sauce? the chilling? the rehidratation of the meat? the acidic ingredients on the marinade? or the sudden change of temperature when I throw it on the flaming hot wok?

And then, a couple days ago, I saw a video where i learned a technique called **brine** first time i ear about it (its not popular here in Argentina) they drown the chicken in salty water overnight, apparently by osmosis an interchange of fluids happens and the chicken gets more salty and less dry when you cook it on the even, french technique i guess.

I am thinking now that this is what happens with the soy marinade every time! am i right?

Maybe I could even make red meat smoother without changing the flavor!.

FWIW, I recall reading somewhere that actual D.O.P. tomatoes exported to U.S. supermarkets are all Grade C, and that the ""good"" crops are kept by the Italians and/or are only accessible to purchase by restaurants.

**My own opinion:** I often find Cento tomatoes to be a bit ""brighter"" in taste than actual D.O.P. tomatoes from brands like Sclafani or La Fede. I'd say a non-discerning, non-picky eater wouldn't really be able to tell the difference. Whereas you can absolutely tell the difference between Cento/Sclafani D.O.P./La Fede D.O.P. vs. domestic tomatoes distributed by Muir Glen, Jersey Fresh, Bianco diNapoli, etc.",t3_er34uz,Comp625,1
267,Success!!!!,"I know I said I was looking at making meatloaf this weekend, but a winter storm had me housebound all weekend, and I decided something going low and slow on the stove would be best.

So, I made spaghetti and meatballs! I come from a family of great cooks, and everyone is pretty critical, so it’s only been in the last few years I’ve started cooking for myself. Today was a huge milestone for me, cooking-wise, as I altered a recipe.

I know, I know, doesn’t sound like much, but for the last 18 months or so, as I’ve made stuff, I’ve looked at the recipe and thought it could be improved, but I’ve been nervous about going off-book. 
Today, I finally trusted my gut, read about 15 different recipes, and I combined what I liked from them. And it paid off! It wasn’t the best spaghetti and meatballs, but it was definitely fine, and I won’t mind eating the leftovers.

My mother hates meatball, so I’ve never even seen someone make them before, but they turned out, and I am so excited.  I think next time I’ll make some adjustments, but for my first attempt, it went pretty well.

269,Making a Garlicky Roast?,"I’m trying my best to replicate my grandmother’s roast recipe, and I don’t know much about it, but I’ve never been able to really get it.

All I can say for sure is that she seared it before hand (no big surprise there) and she put garlic cloves into the meat.

But when it was done it was super, fall-apart tender, and absolutely infused with garlic flavor in every bite.

The only time I’ve personally tasted anything like it is, very randomly to me, at the Iraqi-Jewish restaurant Azura in Jerusalem’s main market, where they serve a “beef sofrito” that is cubes of beef instead of a whole roast.  And damn if it doesn’t taste just like my grandmother’s.

In any event, does anyone have any idea for how to achieve the garlic-in-every-bite, fall-apart roast?  I don’t even know what cut of beef.  And every time I try, even absolutely bombarding the thing with garlic cloves, I get barely any garlic flavor.",t3_er6fjk,Apptubrutae,1

273,How have I waited so long to spatchcock a chicken?,"I have a friend who does it all the time and I decided to give it a shot last night. I couldn't tell you the last time I roasted a whole bird, as I've always felt like it didn't turn out well, like I always overcooked it. But spatchcocking is a game changer. This was literally the best roast chicken I've ever done, and the breast meat was so incredibly moist. Holy crap! And it was so easy!

Preheat oven to 425, line a sheet pan with parchment.

Halve small golden potatoes, slice onions and carrots (I didn't have carrots last night but will the next time), toss with a little olive oil  and salt and pepper and add to sheet pan in a single layer.  You could also add garlic and fresh herbs to the veg.

Flip the bird over and, using kitchen shears, cut along both sides of the spine to remove it.  Then, using a sharp knife, score the breast bone.  Place bird breast side up on top of the veg and press down on the breast bone until it breaks to flatten everything out. 

Brush skin with olive oil and season with salt and pepper and put in the middle rack of the oven. Cook for 45 minute and then check doneness with an instant read thermometer in the breast/thigh, sticking it back in for a few minutes if it's not 165. 

This was so easy and so good.

All these YouTube videos make it out to be a wonder device. However, I tried it and the chicken remained **absolutely raw from the bottom.** 

**Overcooked from the top.** And will you believe it? Besides the chicken getting overcooked from the top, the **marinade was squishy wet everywhere**. When I tried to cut the chicken from the top portion all the marinade came out into my hand.

I also tried cooking french fries by coating the potato in a few drops of oil and it **tastes absolutely nothing like the french fries** from the market. Yes I did that basting shit where we boil potatoes at 60 degrees of water to remove starch and also tried deep freezing the pieces before cooking them. In all cases it made the shittiest french fries I've ever eaten.

I tried making **cutlets** and they too came out shitty. 

It feels like the Air Fryer isn't actually frying the food in any way. It just throws hot air and seems to do a worse job than an ordinary oven. In an oven at least the chicken marinade dries up after a while.

**Has anyone else tried Air Fryers? Have you tried cooking chicken in it? How were the results?**

330,How would I make this high-protein and vegetarian?,"So I had a dish [similar to this](https://tasteofmaroc.com/moroccan-couscous-with-seven-vegetables/) at a Moroccan restaurant (it was vegetarian) and it was absolutely delicious. While I'm not vegetarian persay, I'm trying to get more plants in my diet and limiting my meat consumption to when I eat out. This dish is just so colorful and packed with veggies, it's absolutely awesome.

I'm also pretty new to cooking (I'm aware that this is a little ambitious for a novice cook, but I figure I'll learn either way), and I'm also trying to up my protein intake because I'm trying to build muscle (at 6'3 and 180 lbs, I need a lot). Bodybuilding and tasty, hearty meals aren't usually synonymous (I don't want to eat chicken and steamed broccoli for the rest of my life lol)

So while the recipe does offer a vegetarian version, I want to up the protein. So I was thinking about maybe using tofu (since it basically takes on the flavor of whatever it's cooked in) or maybe seitan. But I'm not sure how that would go, I probably can't cook the tofu the same way she cooks the meat or it'd probably fall apart, correct?

334,I adapted Marcella Hazan's Bolognese recipe with Beyond Beef,"Straight to the important part, pictures: http://imgur.com/a/KKYRVgA

I have wanted to put Beyond ground ""beef"" to the test with Bolognese sauce for a long time, and yesterday I decided to do it. On the blog/recipe sphere, I see a lot of vegetarian and vegan adaptations of Bolognese and the vast majority tend to go off the rails with unnecessary ingredients (well, less unnecessary if vegan) and preparation methods. The question I wanted to answer was, ""Can a classic Bolognese recipe taste comparable when swapped with plant-based meat?""

The very short answer is yes, and I'm sure it would be fine if the *only* adjustment you made was swapping the meat. However - there are two main problems I notice when cooking with plant based ground beef: fat rendering and rich flavor. If you ever scan the back of a Beyond Beef package, the macronutrient composition is almost identical to 80/20 ground beef. Texturally, the stuff definitely holds up. 

To compensate for the fat rendering (or lack thereof) as well as rich flavor I made three adjustments to Marcella's recipe:

* One clove of garlic, very finely minced, added at the end of soffritto sweating. This decision was less about adding garlic to the overall flavor profile than intensifying the other flavors in the dish, which I find garlic does very well in small quantities.

* When sauteeing the Beyond beef, I added three tbsp of tomato paste. If you've ever eaten Beyond beef, it has a faint coconut flavor. Adding tomato early, especially paste, was an attempt to block that flavor note from overpowering the more delicate soffritto, as well as adding some of that glutamate goodness early. Also - I found the tomato paste helped make the soffritto and beef juicier as it broke down in the pot, potentially compensating for some of the loss of fat rendering.

* Speaking of glutamates, I added one medium sized parmesan rind with the 1 1/2 cup of tomatoes just before simmering. I know some new age Bolognese recipes call for fish sauce (Kenji) and other umami boosters, but I wanted to preserve Marcella's recipe as carefully as possible. That meant not just throwing in any flavor enhancer I could think of. 

I served with penne because I didn't have any tagliatelle, so you could say that alone made this a bastardized ragù ;) 

Overall - a delicious meal, served alongside a simple mâche green salad dressed with a lemon vinaigrette to cut through some of the sauce's richness. I'd recommend this plant-based adaptation for anyone looking to experiment with some classics while reducing their carbon footprint.

362,TIFU by not RTFing the meat grinder attachment for my KitchenAid stand mixer,"Not a true fuck up, but I caused myself 3 hours of angst.

We got the meat grinder attachment over the holidays this year. First use was about 2 weeks ago and we made DELICIOUS breakfast sausage from a boneless pork shoulder. Everything worked perfectly! So, today I thought I’d try round 2 with a bone-in pork blade roast that was on sale.

I debone the roast, reassemble and chill the grinder, and everything’s great until I put in the first piece of meat. The meat was grinding, but nothing was coming out. I take apart the grinder and pull off giant pieces of fascia and sinew. Retry- same thing. About 1/2 an inch of meat grinds out before it gunks up with sinew and fascia. Of course, my first troubleshooting source is google, which tells me to freeze the meat and try to remove as much fascia and sinew as I can. I do that, and rechill the meat.   

Round 2 -same result. Now I’m doubting the quality of the roast. Maybe there’s too much sinew?? Convinced it must be the meat, I go buy the same whole boneless shoulder we used the last time. 3rd try and almost 3 hours later, still no meat coming out! Now I’m freaking out because there’s no way the machine would break after just one use!   

Luckily, at this point the husband comes home and before I’m even done telling him my tragic story, he asks me if I made sure to put in all the pieces. Lightbulb moment. I scramble for the manual and lo and behold, I forgot to put in the GRINDING BLADE. Cue massive facepalm, and now I’m stuck with over 20lbs of pork for two people.

TL;DR I forgot to put in a key component of the grinding attachment and thought it was an issue with the quality of the pork so I bought more pork. Now I have 20lbs of pork. Send help. (Or you know, recipes)

384,I ruined two pie crusts in one night because I didn't know how to use pie weights correctly...,"Last night, my husband and I tried to make a delicious pot pie out of one of our new cookbooks. We got some pie weights as a Christmas gift that are loose ceramic beads and decided to try them out for our crust.

He had premade a gorgeous cream cheese pie crust that he was so excited to use, and in our excitement, we dumped the weights right into the pie crust before noticing a fine dust all over the beads. After some internet research, we determined it was ceramic dust which is absolutely not safe to ingest and impossible to remove from sticky dough.

Crust #1 down.

After wallowing in self pity for a few minutes at our stupidity and failed crust, he informs me that he actually made a second crust to save for a later date that we can use now. We throw the first one out, wash the dust off the beads and dry them. We roll out the second crust, drop the weights in, and bake for ten minutes. When we remove the crust to pull the beads out, we realized they had all sunk straight into the crust and were now a big gooey mess that we were unable to remove without tearing it to bits, and our second pie crust was ruined.

Crust #2 down.

At this point, we have a frozen crust in the freezer we decide we have to use since we ran out of ingredients for the fresh crust. The instructions for thawing: ""Allow to thaw on counter for 60-90 minutes. DO NOT MICROWAVE FROZEN CRUST""

So here we are at 7pm on a weekday with two failed crusts and a frozen one that won't thaw nearly in time for us to eat dinner. We ended up ordering pizza and saving the filling for next week.

This morning, discussing it with a co-worker revealed that you're supposed to use parchment paper to line the crust first. -___- Of course, I should know better.

So for all my fellow cooks out there learning new equipment, here are your two hot tips for pie weights:

1) wash and dry your weights thoroughly before use
2) line the crust with parchment paper before you bake

Don't repeat my mistakes, y'all.

385,"Need to one-up my snack game for a party, something over the top or impressive","TLDR: Need to make party snacks that will totally own! 


Last year we hosted a pre game party before a big charity event, the event includes dinner and snacks so we just made cocktails and didn't bother providing any food at our house. 
Normally when we host, I love cooking and showing off, but this wasn't the time for that. Except...


This girl we invited came with buffalo chicken dip, baked filled wonton cups, baked brie (&lt;-- all homemade), cheeses, assorted crackers, and jams, the specialty ones you find near the deli. She's my SO's coworker and it was her first time at our place and my first time meeting her. Yes, everything was delicious and everyone loved it but she just... in my house... the audacity!


We have another event coming up next weekend and I won't make the same mistake. I am filled with petty revenge! I don't hate her or anything, I'm rather impressed in fact, I just got a reputation to uphold and a kitchen to defend. 


I need to make something amazing, something people will eat up, something showy. I am willing to call off work that day to spend the day cooking, I'm willing to shell out a bit more money, I'll even make a croquembouche cone if that's what it takes (really don't want to though).


Most of our friends are basic home cooks or less, so could be something that's not necessarily labor intensive or expensive.
I've made hummus before, which is not hard but people are always impressed. I was thinking about cream puffs shaped like swans, I've made it before and it looks way more difficult than it is. Also got ingredients for a smoked salmon and lettuce spring rolls.

It’s still rich and flavorful but it needs more of the “sauce” itself.

I want to stretch it out if I could but not at the cost of the flavor itself.  I just do not know what route to take.  I can’t imagine adding pasta sauce to be a subtle solution, nor just adding veal stock (of which I have plenty of) that has been slightly reduced.  What are your recommendations?

But I've got a huge sweet tooth so this was really good.

If anyone has any sweeter sauce that they like with onion rings I'd take a recipe. Or if anyone would like to help me reverse engineer this sauce that'd be cool too.

As per the title really. On Wednesday evening both me and my partner play sport. Often we don’t kick off till 7.30 (or later) so we don’t get home till about 9.30 or so.

435,My homemade Mac and Cheese is not as good as Stouffers',"I eat Stouffers Mac and Cheese at least three times a week. I want to save some money and was told that I can make it myself and it would be much better. But after three attempts I am starting to lose hope. Stouffers is much more satisfying than what I have cooked. Specifically it is the sauce that just doesn't do it for me - it seems to be missing some kind of wonderful kick that Stouffers has.

Does anyone have some advice on how to make my mac and cheese great?

I use the following ingredients:

    1 tablespoon butter
    1 tablespoon flour
    2 cups of whole milk (usually need to add another 0.5 to 1 cup of milk because it is way too thick)
    1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese
    2 cups of macaroni elbows

I use the following method:

&gt;Prepare the milk so it can warm up to room temperature

&gt;Add the butter until it is sizzling and throw in the flour. Mix constantly until tan. This probably takes 5 minutes maybe more.

&gt;Add the milk in and mix constantly. It takes a long time, at least 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes before all the flakes disappear and it starts to thicken.

&gt;Add the cheese in and mix constantly. After 2-3 minutes it becomes way to thick so I add another 0.5 to 1 cup of milk.

&gt;At some point mix some pre-al-dente macaroni elbows and stir until the macaroni becomes al-dente and then eat.

I do not have an oven, so I'm not able to broil some cheese on top. Is that the secret? If so then I am out of luck.

Everyone says you need to buy a block of cheese instead of buying pre-shredded cheese. I'm willing to try this, but I find it hard to believe that the difference between my barely adequate macncheese and a good stouffers' version is simply the difference between a block of cheese and pre-shredded cheese. 

Should I be adding mustard powder or anything like that? I did not see it listed on the Stouffers ingredients.",t3_eq8wee,chinawcswing,1

439,Another broth story.,"So yesterday I made some kick ass ""boiled dinner"" that I heard about from Matty Matteson's youtube channel. Came out really good. I cooked a whole chicken, some nice beef and pork ribs and onions, carrots, bay leaf and a few other somewhat expensive ingredients purchased from a local butcher block.

Once we removed the meat, there was a nice, real nice stock. I had plans for some good soup with that stock. Loaded chicken noodle soup that could make your toes curl. It was still very hot, so I let it cool on an oven mitt while we ate our fill of the meat. Afterwards, as I was putting away dinner, my wife got to the dishes and wouldn't you know? She dropped the broth in the drain. I told her specifically to keep it, but she still accidentally threw it away. Brain fart!

Anyway I love my wife more than soup so I quickly forgave her and we finished watching an anime on crunchyroll and went to bed. Because I'm not a sociopath.

The problem? The steak is rock-hard but the marinade feels like a firm slush around it. It feels like very cold oil; not quite solid, not quite liquid.

456,Rainy day soup,"So this is a recipe my mom made for my older sister and I for as long as either of us can remember, although slightly tweaked by me over the years for various reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

* 1 can Campbells Bean with Bacon Soup
* 1 can whole milk
* 1/2 can half and half
* 1/4 tsp roasted garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp umami powder

So, originally my mom just used the milk and half and half, over time I started using the additional seasonings to deal with the coppery taste that this particular soup sometimes gets coming out of a can. I have researched the reason for it happening to some extent, and as far as I can tell Campbells is aware of the issue, but has no fix for it and it's supposedly not a health hazard, just an off taste.

Combine all ingredients in a stock pot (I prefer a saucier) and cook on medium low heat until it thickens, stirring frequently. I cook it until it almost has the thickness of a gravy.

I also make this ahead of time to take to work for dipping sandwiches in. When I do, I transfer the soup to a tall tupperware or jar, and blend with a stick blender until smooth because I don't care about the texture of the beans. Also, doing this results in an even thicker soup

It's absolutely amazing for dipping a grilled cheese sandwich in. I just made a smoked gouda grilled cheese to dip in it and that was even more amazing.

Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: for spelling.

Edit the second: So, obviously this is a fairly calorie dense recipe, I'd say one can is enough to feed two people, especially if you blend it like I do because it makes distribution more easy (neither person ends up with too many beans and not enough liquid).",t3_eq9er7,TrikStari,1

491,What commonly refrigerated foods/ingredients don't actually need to be or will last surprisingly long outside of a refrigerator?," 

I've found that I love camping, hiking, and the outdoors. One of the things I really enjoy doing is cooking over an open fire or a bed of coals As I venture deeper into the woods for longer I realize I'd like to leave my cooler at home when I go hiking/camping. The thing is that I still want to make foods from at least semi-fresh ingredients rather than freeze dried or canned foods without having to lug a cooler with me. At some point it dawned on me that at one point in time many of the foods we refrigerate didn't always need to be. A long time ago or even in some places today people didn't refrigerate eggs, cheese, cured meats, milk. At some point along the way we started processing or packaging things differently and requiring them to be refrigerated to extend shelf-life. My question is what commonly refrigerated things today will actually last awhile without being refrigerated assuming they are kept in a cool(ish) dry place like a backpack? What tips or tricks are there to help prolong edibility of things without refrigeration?

I know things are processed differently all over the word, so for reference I am in the United States.",t3_epwk6j,Rustworthy89,1

I'm always surprised when people describe what they're tasting, sometimes it's completely different from what I experience.

I think lamb is delicious. I had some the other day and it was heavily seasoned with rosemary, black pepper and garlic, then cooked in a tomato sauce. I think the ""gameyness"" really helped the dish and brought out the flavors of the spices. Actually, I liked it so much, I may swear off ground beef forever, except for burgers, of course.

On the other hand, I no longer like ground beef, it doesn't have enough flavor for me. I almost exclusively cook with short rib, chuck or brisket because it has more flavor (I'm talking about beef used in dishes). If I had a choice, I think I'd always pick the lamb.

543,Can you make am unleavened bread using only bean flour/potato flour?,"I lurk here a lot and feel this would be the right place to ask. I learned how to bake basic breads like bannock and cornbread, but I was wondering if you can make an ""edible"" bread/flatbread/tortilla using only bean/potato flour, water and salt (something similar to pre-hardened hardtack). I only found an East Asian recipe involving only potato flour, but it also happens to use butter and an ingredient I can't pronounce but know I can't get in america without Amazon.  And this one: [https://www.happyfoodstube.com/mashed-potato-flatbread/](https://www.happyfoodstube.com/mashed-potato-flatbread/)

Now I have good tofu but overly gingery soba noodles that are nearly inedible. :( 

The past few things I’ve made have ended up like this too. Pasta too peppery, veggies too mushy, etc.

593,Venting/In search of very quick meal ideas.,"I'm going to do a some venting, so please bear with me. TL;DR at the bottom. 

My husband and I have been together for 10 years. I can count on two hands the amount of times he has actually prepared and cooked us a meal. I do love cooking, and I've become good at it. He isn't bad by any means, and I've really enjoyed all the meals he has made.

I'm growing increasingly frustrated with his lack of help in this area. He won't clean any part of the bathroom because he has a ""thing"" about germs; he won't take the trash out for the same reason; he doesn't take care of the cats because that was our agreement for getting them (it was); he won't take care of the dog for reasons unknown; he won't do any cleaning of the fridge or sink; and he won't cook because his reasoning is that I like to do it. 

Don't get me wrong, he does clean. He declutters, vacuums, sweeps, mops, does the laundry including mine, and is responsible for doing the dishes after dinner, among other things, but I don't know that he realizes what a chore it is sometimes to cook after a long day. I asked him to make dinner the other night after a particularly long day and he declined. It was literally just tacos and took me less than 30 minutes start to finish, but he said that I'm ""better at it"" and like cooking (so clearly I must want to every day)? I tried to explain what a luxury it is to be able to relax from the time you get home til when you go to bed while I'm in the kitchen for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half, but he doesn't really get it.

Finally today (which is actually our anniversary) he asked if I wanted anything on his way home and specified he wasn't picking up dinner because I should really cook since I had a day off. For reference, the reason I had a ""day off"" was because someone broke into my car and shattered my windshield, so my ""day off"" was filled with police reports, taking myself to get my window replaced, and then working from home in between.

TL;DR I am really, desperately in need of very, very quick recipes. Like under 30 minutes. He will not eat leftovers. He will not touch anything that's been reheated. He doesn't like soups or stews except chili because he doesn't like his food all mixed. He also will not eat mushrooms.",t3_epast7,briittanyy,1

But a few years ago, my husband and I read an article in lucky peach that we didn’t realize was fantasy. It was about finding a hidden restaurant I think on an island with a chef—the descriptions of the food and these fantasy ingredients was so magical. It was so captivating and it wasn’t until the article ended that we realized it wasn’t a real place. I want to say the chef was Asian. There’s a chance it wasn’t in Lucky Peach but I feel about 80% sure it was. Thought it was worth a shot in the dark...

Some more details: my husband and I both remember the fictional chef as being Asian, he’d worked in a lot of restaurants and the author had to travel to find him. He was underground, had to go through a tunnel to get to his restaurant.

Could also be mcsweeneys. Year was around 2013. It was printed in a magazine.

UPDATE!: found it!! My husband wrote the editor Peter Meehan thinking it was a long shot and he not only responded BUT HE WROTE THE ARTICLE! It’s in the Chinatown edition of lucky peach and he’s going to send it to us. I’ll post here once that happens.

602,Seeking some advice on Marinades,"So I was talking with a coworker about cooking, and we got on the topic of marinades. Now, for beef and chicken I know how to make a wine/vinegar based marinade, which I then do a reduction with after I cook the meat (in the same pan of course). 

But my coworker sometimes uses more creamy marinades and I don't know how to cook those into a sauce after words, just reducing them doesn't seem right but they've touched raw meat for a prolonged period, so cooking them seems like a really good idea. Any suggestions on how she can not waste the creamier marinades?

Also, she cooks with pork way more than I do and is interested in how to make a marinade for pork. I think you could use either red or white, depending on what other flavors you are adding (my instinct says red for spicy or pungent, white for herbal/light flavors), but she'd love any recipies. 

My problem is that I don't really do recipes so much as ideas, and adjust on the fly. This is fine if you are comfortable with it, but she is more comfortable with following a recipe. Of course, the disadvantage of my style is that the same dish never comes out exactly the same twice.

604,Eating food left out for extended periods of time.,"So recently I’ve taken notice, when i drink espically, i have a bad habit of leaving cooked food out for ridiculous periods of time before i eat it. For example, the other night i made chicken legs and let them sit on top of the stove for 3 1/2 hours before i ate them cold..i regularly do the same thing with ground beef, fish, etc...this has me wondering, are the regulations surrounding food storage in today’s world largely exaggerated? I’ve been doing this for decades and have never once gotten sick. Random post, but I really am curious to know, can some people handle spoiled/bad food better than others, or is the whole “dispose of cooked chicken after it’s left out for 2 or more hours” and such all a huge exaggeration for our overall safety?",t3_epeqvm,Allocerr,1

I followed the recipe exactly, but was pretty disappointed with the way it turned out. The flavor was just kind of, gross, to me. It was better when I would take a bite of potato with a bite of meat, as the potato would help to mellow the flavor, but it was definitely not what I was expecting. 

My father-in-law, on the other hand, loved it. He is retired but used to be an exec and would often eat at fancy restaurants for business meals, and said that the meat reminded him of something he would have gotten at a nice restaurant (just like the recipe said).

It might be whacky to list ingredients down for something so simple, but as usual, everything is listed below. Let me know if you try this one out.

* 1 medium wheel of creamy, young Brie cheese
* Fresh Black Winter Truffle, shaved on rasp grater (as much or as little as your heart desires.)
* Good EVOO, a few glugs
* Kosher Salt + Ground Black Pep

623,The Truth About Cooking TV Shows,"Hey guys. As you know by the title I will tell you some truths about all cooking TV shows that you see on TV and some of the things that I will tell you will BLOW YOUR MIND. 

First of all, I want to acknowledge you by the fact that I was in a cooking TV show (won't mention which one for not tracking my identity ). I am telling you this because I for once have been wondering how do they do that so perfectly how that and how that. Many mysteries but no answers. Here you go

**First of all.** The way you get into a show is either you get called ( to get called you must be found by them by your ethnic background or get recommended ). You cant just sign up and voila. 

**2.** You won't be called and oh hey ok come. You will get a lot of calls. Meetings. Different things that you cant and can do and it will all be stressful. I almost quit halfway into them accepting me for the show.

**3.** **YOU NEVER EVER EVER** get to cook something by yourself or just out of nowhere. What I mean ""just out of nowhere"" when you see those mystery boxes and in most cases, people get from the judges what they cook. That is **FAKE**. They notify you in advance of what you will cook so you can prepare. This got me blown away btw.

**4**. When going on the show. You have to get dressed by them, makeup by them, you have to shower, you cant wear electronics due to those little microphones that everyone has. 

**5.** When going on the show you will have a guide telling you where to go, what to do while on it and a lot more stuff. This is not every time just when entering, leaving and similar actions.

**6.** RETAKING SCENES. Yes, we retake scenes. And a lot of the scenes that are normal are left out. Judges can always stop the scene but you cant

**7.** You know those moments when chefs look like they are describing the scene in a room full of things like ""I am stressed out don't know what to do hope I win this"" while not cooking. Those are done when EVERYTHING ends. Literally. You have to wait to do that and then you can say that and they tell you what you will be describing etc.. Knowing this I always look at the body language to see who won and not. 

**8.** The rewards ( money etc. ) Is given a month after. Yes, this is sad but it is how it is. They also give out bonus things like pans, food, etc.",t3_ep8mnd,real_laurieee,1

My 1 rule is that I refuse to do a casserole. I hold myself to a higher standard than to rely on an egg based casserole, besides I'm not a huge fan of them anyway. 

We are on the fence whether are going for a seated meal or buffet style. Depending on the exact headcount will determine that, but I'm down for ideas catered to either.

This was my second time making this recipe and while this one was exponentially better, its consitenticy wasn't... gumbo... 

Only thing I figured would cause this was too much our or not enough stock, which I dont think was the case, as the rue came out perfect from what I thought.

I had a few different ingredients this time, is opposed to last time, as this was a shrimp based gumbo. I used Modelo instead of Guinness beer, small batch 4 Rose's instead of wild turkey, home made shrimp stock instead of canned chicken stock/broth(can't remember), and as mentioned shrimp, instead of chicken and sausage. I wouldn't think the consistency would changed by any of those changes.

630,"Tweaking a ""power waffle"" recipe","I am in the process of tweaking a ""power waffle"" recipe I found online(it was *edible*, but I am pretty sure I can make it better). 

The original recipe
+ 6 eggs
+ 2cups greek yogurt
+ 2cups rolled oats
+ 1/2 tsp vanilla
+ 1 tsp baking powder
+ pinch salt

Combine in a blender and puree till smooth. Made 4 waffles in our waffle maker, and half of one fits our toaster, and have like 160cal and 13g protein.

They were a tad too tart and dense for my liking. I am thinking of adding a couple tbsp of honey to the batter to sweeten it up a bit, an I am thinking of separating the eggs, beating the whites(soft peak?), and folding them in to the batter to lighten it up.

632,Perfect Korean Fried Chicken made at home,"Korean Fried Chicken is one of my favourite food and I've spent the past few years creating something that's close to what's been served in Korea. Because I want everyone to get cooking, I have posted a video on how to make 4 different types of my favourite Korean Fried chicken. For anyone interested, here is the link: [https://youtu.be/ggCmosKSvvw](https://youtu.be/ggCmosKSvvw)

But in Summary

Ingredients for Fried Chicken

* Chicken
* Pre-made frying mix (or mix flour, cornstarch, baking powder, garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper) 
* Full fat milk (why are you making fried chicken with skim fat milk) 
* Vegetable oil
* Salt
* Pepper
* MSG

Tips and tricks

* The longer you marinade the chicken in milk and seasoning mixture, the better chicken will taste
* MSG is required if you want to replicate that restaurant quality taste. You don't need much, but it might be the most important ingredient in this recipe
* Shaking the wet battered chicken in the dry batter gives that wavey crispy texture, I've tried to just rub it on and it completely changed the texture
* Do not crowd the pot - if you do, you will get well oiled steamed chicken rather than crispy fried chicken
* All my measurements are in portion sizes rather than tbsp and cup sizes. Because this way, you can make this without using the measuring tools

I use x : 2x for 1c of oatmeal but want to make more and that gets to be a lot of water fast.

Brown rice is just a mystery to me.  Recommendations online also say x : 2x but again, a lot of water fast.

There is a chicken restaurant in Seoul, South Korea called Mattacco. They have a very unique baked chicken offering that I have been trying to replicate (on the menu it’s 현미베이크 translated as brown rice bake chicken). Does anyone know of some recipes to help point me in the right direction? I believe it is baked with a certain type of brown rice, because I tried standard medium grain and it didn’t turn out well. Would the rice require cooking before? The texture of the chicken is similar to Rice Krispies.

So far, I made:

* plain simple syrup

* cinnamon syrup

* orange syrup

* pineapple syrup

All of these are mostly used to sweeten beverages, such as coffee and *jamaica*.

I made the pineapple one based on the seriouseats recipe, and am now attempting to extract some from orange rinds (the recipe was for lemon, but I figured I'd try). I am loving it! Except for the time I put in ny coffee into the crystalizing cinnamon syrup, and ended up with coffee so sweet, I had to throw away, even after I dumped shitty office coffee on top. Yeah, underestimated the amount big time.

Background:
It started with thr boring task of trying to mix sugar into my jamaica. So much work. So I made simple syrup. It was cool. So I wondered if a flavored version would be nice. It was. I make about 1.5 cups a batch, and it lasts me about 2 weeks. 

Orange syrup:
I made this by boiling orange rinds. It has a nice subtle flavor. I tried a piece of now-candied rind, but it's not my thing. I am also trying the seriouseats recipe where you just dump some sugar to pull the flavor from the rind. I'll have to compare, but the one I boiled had a subtle flavor, and I expect the sugar one will be stronger.

 I guess mango will be next for this method.

2- cucumbers 
1.5- red onion
3 avocados 
1- garlic clove

Mayo
Kosher salt
Black pepper
10 large limes

Butterfly and wash the shrimp. Put them in a 13""x9"" baking dish or similar and spread them out evenly. Add kosher salt and black pepper. (I dont have a actual measurement for the amounts, season to taste. Also you will use more salt and the whole pepper corns later so not too much.) Cut 2 lemons and squeeze over the shrimp mixing it all up. Peel the cucumbers and cut them in half length wise. Using a spoon remove the seeds.  Cut the cucumbers and thin slice the onions and add to the shrimp. Take 2 of the serrano peppers and slice them into rounds. Add them to the shrimp and  mix it again adding a little more kosher salt and pepper. 

In a blender add all of the chillies, garlic clove, pepper corns and the juice from the remaining limes and blend it until everything is dissolved. Taste the mix and add kosher salt if needed. Add the mix to the shrimp mixing it all up with the lime juice that was already in the shrimp and put it in the fridge for about 20 min.

Put some mayo on a tostada pile on the shrimp with onions and cucumbers and top it with sliced avocado. https://imgur.com/bM886Xx.jpg

Here's a classic of mine.   I decided to make homemade pizza for my then-teenaged daughter. It was a spur of the moment decision, but I  had all the ingredients, including homemade sauce and grated mozzarella in the freezer.

We assembled the pizza together, topping our creation with sauteed veggies and sprinkling on cheese from the unmarked Ziploc freezer bag.

The time went off but the cheese wasn't melted yet. 

I gave it more time. Still not melted.  Strange.  The crust was getting pretty brown, so I stuck the pizza under the broiler. Nothing.

We were quite hungry, so we pulled it out of the oven. She took a bite, looked at me in astonishment and blurted out: ""POTATOES!"".

692,Help with food sticking,"I have a decent understanding of combining flavors and a few techniques etc, but a pretty poor understanding of temp control and what I feel like is conflicting results. This happens to me seemingly at random regardless of using aluminum, stainless, cast iron, and carbon steel.

Eggs- seemingly random. Heating up slowly sometimes is great, sometimes sticks. If I preheat for a while to a med heat and then dump in, browns a little and USUALLY releases fine, but occasionally sticks horribly. 

Searing in ci- heat on high for a long time, pour in some high temp neutral oil, usually grapeseed, then put in food. If searing meat, usually sticks somewhat, but will come up eventually. This seems to follow the whole ""if it sticks, wait. It isn't done yet"" thing. However, there is usually carbon buildup, and so subsequent pieces tend to stick horribly and have some of this carbon buildup in them.

Sauteeing- usually goes fine as long as things are moved intermittently. However, if I try to get some browning on stuff and let it sit in place a min or so, it will get some color, but things begin to almost gum up and begin to stick. Seems to be opposite of ""if it sticks....""

693,Looking for Prep Tips,"I pick up my daughter from daycare at 5 PM and put her to bed at 7 PM, after which my husband and I have dinner together. Thankfully I work from home so I can do some dinner prep during the day to help make sure we eat at a reasonable time (e.g. before 8 PM).

\[Before anyone asks, my husband definitely does his fair share of the housework and child-rearing - for instance, he gets up with her in the morning and takes her to daycare and does all of the dishes after we're done eating. I love to cook and hate waking up early so this is the best setup for us currently.\]

Anyway, here's what I'm making tonight:

[*Moroccan-Spiced Fish*](https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/moroccan-spiced-fish)

* *12 small carrots, halved lengthwise if large*
* *1½ pounds fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise*
* *1 lemon, thinly sliced*
* *½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper*
* *3 tablespoons olive oil, divided*
* *1¼ teaspoons kosher salt, divided*
* *½ teaspoon ground cumin*
* *½ teaspoon ground coriander*
* *⅛ teaspoon ground allspice*
* *4 6-oz. skinless cod fillets*
* *3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley*

*Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss carrots, potatoes, lemon, pepper, 2 tablespoons of the oil, and 1 teaspoon of the salt on a rimmed baking sheet; arrange in a single layer. Roast until potatoes are almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes.*

*Meanwhile, stir together cumin, coriander, allspice, and remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small bowl. Rub the mixture evenly over cod and season with remaining ¼ teaspoon salt.*

*Remove baking sheet from oven and increase heat to broil. Nestle cod fillets among vegetables and return to oven. Broil on top rack until fish is just cooked through and vegetables are tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Top with parsley.*

Tonight I plan to prep and season the veggies ahead of time, place them on a baking sheet, cover them, and keep them in the fridge. Then I'll take them out of the fridge and preheat the oven during the kiddo's bedtime routine so that as soon as she's down I can put the veggies straight in the oven and proceed with the rest of the recipe as written

The types of questions I ask myself are: Will the veggies dry out in the fridge? Will their texture be compromised by being preseasoned? Which proteins (e.g. fish, pork) are negatively affected by things like preseasoning and acidic marinades?

I live in a fairly hot place (Australia) but will have a cooler pack in the lunch bag. There’s no access to heat the food up. 

The meal times are:

-	10:30am - Recess (Morning Tea)
-	12:30pm - Lunch
-	3:00pm - Afternoon tea

Currently what I’m thinking is:

-	10:30am - Chicken and Mayo sandwich
-	12:30pm - Ham, cheese and veggies (Tomato, cucumber, lettuce, etc) sandwich + piece of fruit
-	3:00pm - Biscuits/Unsalted Popcorn

741,Retro cookbook recommendation.,"I once bought a cook book with Marlboro miles back in the nineties. I still use it to this day. It's called the ""Cook Like a Man"" cookbook and it focuses mostly on grilling. I never expected a free cookbook from a cigarette company to actually be good, but it is. It's not for sale in the Marlboro miles store anymore, but it's not too expensive to get a used copy on E-bay or whatever. They have this one recipe where you core apples, stuff them with nuts, cinnamon, butter and various other things. Then wrap them in foil and grill them so the stuffings soak in. Those are always a big hit with the family at Christmas. It's also where I got my favorite BBQ sauce recipe. If you like grilling I highly recommend it. It's not often that I like something, so when I do I try to pass it along. I hate everything, so if I like it you know it's good. I found it on Amazon for $19 if anyone is interested. https://www.amazon.com/Marlboro-Cook-Like-Man-Cookbook/dp/B000AMAYOK

I don't think it imparts any olive oiley flavour I can notice (probably mainly because the refined stuff isn't very flavoursome to start with), so what's the point? Perhaps I should just be using extra virgin olive oil when I want olive oil flavour in cooking (a cheap version when cooking...) and neutral oil when it doesn't matter.


There seem to be conflicting views on this amongst chefs, with some saying it's a waste to cook with extra virgin olive oil and some seeming to use it for everything.

Here's the video on how to make it: [https://youtu.be/DSTm3aku29I](https://youtu.be/DSTm3aku29I)

Here's the recipe:

INGREDIENTS \* 2 cups + 2 tablespoons all purpose flour 

\* 1 teaspoon baking soda 

\* 2 teaspoons cornstarch 

\* 1 teaspoon salt 

\* 1 ½ sticks (6 oz) butter, melted, browned and cooled 

\* 1 cup dark brown sugar, lightly packed 

\* ½ cup granulated sugar 

\* 2 large eggs 

\* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 

\* 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips 

\* 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips 

\* 1/4 cup white chocolate chips 

\* 1/4 cup caramel baking chips 

\* 1 tbsp flake salt  

INSTRUCTIONS 

1. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt. Set aside. 

2. In a small sauce pan, melt butter over medium heat. Swirl the pan occasionally. The butter will foam and eventually turn a golden brown color.  Remove from heat and let cool. 

3. In a large bowl, beat together the cooled melted butter and the sugars with a hand-mixer or stand-mixer for about one minute. Then, add in the eggs and vanilla extract. Beat until just combined. 

4. Slowly add in the dry ingredients and mix briefly, just until there are no flour clumps left. Fold in all of the chocolate and caramel chips. 

5. Cover and refrigerate the dough for at least one hour (the colder the better). 

6. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and preheat the oven to 350°F, making sure you have the racks in the middle of the oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. 

7. Scoop 1/4 cup of cookie dough at a time and roll into balls. Place at least 2” apart on the baking sheet.  

8. Top each ball of cookie dough with a pinch of flake salt. 

9. Bake for about 10-14 minutes, rotating half-way through, or until the cookies have spread out and the edges are golden, but the centers of the cookies still look soft and undercooked. Every oven is different, so watch closely and cook them to your preference. 

10. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets until the cookies are firm enough to remove, about 15 minutes. Before they are completely cooled, you may add more chocolate chips by gently pressing them into the cookie. 

11. Repeat with remaining batches, until all cookies are baked.

824,Stand Mixer Recommendation,"Hello, I'm looking for recommendations for a nice mixer for my wife.

Just before Christmas Costco had the 6 qt. KitchenAid Pro mixer for $249 ($80 off their normal price), so we jumped on it. After using it a few times, my wife felt that it was too much mixer for her (the bowl was too big for making small batches of dough and she didn't like the bowl lift mechanism), so we returned it last night.

I'd like her to get something nice but have seen others on this subreddit recommend against KitchenAid due to quality control issues.

We are looking for a tilt-head mixer in the 4-5 quart range. She will mainly be making cookies, cakes and frostings with it, but could potentially get into bread making. She likes the idea of being able to use the KitchenAid add-on attachments, so we consider that a plus but not necessarily a must-have. Costco has a 4.5 quart, 300W tilt-head KitchenAid for $199 we are considering.  


We'd love to get your thoughts and recommendations. Our budget maxes out at about $300.

AskBaking folks. I tried to search the internet, and later also this sub for an answer to this question so that I wouldn't have to ask it but alas I couldn't find anything.

What I'm looking for are ideas on how to make streusel that takes longer to bake. Like, an hour long or even a bit longer.

I'm generally considered good at baking by those around me, and it is to at least a degree true as I can do weird and/or horrible things to recipes and have nice results, but the best idea I could come up with here is making dense dough that I freeze and then grind. And not only is this something that takes way more time time (about an hour in the fridge, then another one plus some freezing) but I'm also worried that I may have gone beyond where reasonable alterations go and into the realm of insane ideas. And making standard streusel, baking it separately from the cake, and then merging them together at the end ... it doesn't really work unless I glue them together unless the cake itself is gluey (which isn't the case often) and making edible glue just isn't cost-effective for me (no local availability of certain ingredients outside of speciality stores with frankly ridiculous mark-up).

There's this family recipe for dough, that we use for apple pies and mince pies. My father got it from his mother, who (iirc) got it from her mother, and obviously, if I ever have children, they'll get it from me. But it's a fairly unusual recipe, and I've never encountered a recipe like it anywhere else. The ingredients are:

&amp;#x200B;

1/2 lb flour

1/4 lb unsalted butter

3/4 cups sugar

3 heaped tablespoons of baking powder

1 egg, beaten up

&amp;#x200B;

What you end up with is a dough that is very sweet and also, due to the large quantities of baking powder, kind of fizzy. It sounds weird, but it's delicious--as long as you use a baking powder formulated without disodium phosphate.

The fudge still wasn't near hard enough either, so I put it back in. I took it out today and it's now rock hard and the liquid has solidified and turned a whiteish yellowish color. There's a little bit of it on the surface of parts of the fudge now, too, not just the edges/corners.

I *think* this might be because I used too much butter in the pan. The recipe said to put tin foil in a metal pan, but we didn't have tin foil that would work, so my mom looked up what other recipes did and then told me to use butter to grease a glass pan and put it in there. Would that be what's accumulating on the edges? I'm kind of confused why it's on the surface too if that's it. Should I just only ever use tin foil in the future? 

Also, I want to ship fudge to someone across the country soon. I noticed that the fudge is rock hard when it's in the fridge but softens up to be squishy (but not melting) if I leave some out for a while. Is that normal?

I was just wondering what some tried and true fruit combinations for cake were? I think I want to keep the peach, since it's summer here in Australia and peach is quite a light flavour, but I'm unsure of whether there's another fruit that would compliment peach without overwhelming it - I'm planning to still keep the mousse peach, and just make one of the jelly layers and then the thin layer of mousse on top flavoured differently to prevent that. My other thought was maybe to ditch the peach and do an orange and grapefuit combo, as citrus is also quite refreshing?

Another question too (sorry); in the video they use a sponge cake - would I be able to use a chiffon cake instead?? I absolutely love love love how light it is, and think it would help make it a really light cake overall, but aren't sure if the gelatin in the mousse has enough structural integrity to prevent it from crushing the cake into a pancake

I have read that, in general, you can subsitute about 1/4 of the flour in a vanilla mix with cocoa powder, but some say that makes it too dry.  One person suggested simply adding 3 tbsp of cocoa powder and 100g melted dark chocolate without removing any flour.  my dual concerns are not making the cake too dry and keeping the batter thick enough to support the inner layer.

As for said inner layer, the original recipe calls for cream cheese, melted chocolate chips and an egg.  I was thinking I could simply replace the chocolate chips with melted down peppermint bark.  I may add a little peppermint exract and a few drops of red food dye to give it a nice candy cane pink.

946,Please help me build a really challenging gingerbread figure,"Hi everybody! I need some advice on building a gingerbread figure. Instead of a house, I want to build a figure (don't want to ""reveal"" yet what exactly it is, but I promise to post it here if I succeed^^. It's also not something most people will be familiar with).  Basically, it consists of 2 big pieces, which are triangular, and stuck together along the longest sides - forming a diamond. The hard part starts here: The figure must be standing upwards, ever so slightly leaning back. Obviously it won't stand just like that, but the lower part of the diamond will be supported by several small ""legs"", and it can also be slightly leaning on something for extra support, which however should be only about 1/4th of the length of the diamond.

I hope [this awesome painting here](https://imgur.com/3LBHqE8) helps depict how I want this thing to look like.... :D (the white stuff is just frosting) x)
Now the question is how to actually do that...
I already tried it few years back, by securing the two triangles with each other by sticking them together with several toothpicks. That even worked pretty well. Obviously however, i couldn't manage do keep it standing upwards, as either the whole thing would fall over, split along the middle, or the legs would fall off (that's the second hard part, how to keep the small legs from breaking/ falling off under the weight of the diamond).
I was suggested to first make a ""skeleton"" out of something for support, but I don't know what I can use, so that the gingerbread still stays potentially edible (I believe using a wire for example wouldn't work?), and how to do that in the first place.
I would be really thankful for any tipps so that I can finally manage to build my dream gingerbread ""house"" for christmas this year. I know it is potentially challenging, however I'm sure it's possible with the correct strategy... :))))

I'm having a christmas party with friends on the first, and have decided that making massive levain-style cookies (bakery in NY) is worth the the undertaking, despite the extra cost and effort of less cookies on each sheet. Because it's christmas related, I've decided to cut the walnuts (also I'm a poor student) but add a peppermint flavour, and was wondering which way you guys thought was the best way to do so. Currently I know of 3;

1) Add crushed up candy canes. This, IMO, potentially leads to ruined texture because crispiness is overtaken by crunchiness and lolly getting stuck in your teeth

2) Add peppermint extra to the dough itself - I'm worried about a 'toothpaste' like effect occuring if I do this though (I've never had any cake or dough before that's peppermint flavoured, and I think there' s a good reason why)

3) Add some peppermint chocolate in with the normal milk chocolate.

The 3rd option is, faily obviously, the one I'm leaning toward, but I honestly haven't tried any of the above, and the cheapest peppermint chocolate I know of (Lindt) is still fairly pricey.

I'm working on making a second batch of [Bon Appetit's ""Best Morning Buns""](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-morning-buns) recipe, but was looking to make a change or two.

a lot of the articles I've read online (almost all of which talk going from AP/bread ---&gt; whole wheat) say that there's a rough ratio of 1 cup AP/bread to 3/4ths cup whole wheat, but that you also need to add a small amount of liquid (water/milk/whatever) when making this switch. 

does it stand to reason that going from whole wheat --&gt; AP/bread means that you slightly increase the amount of AP/bread flour and slightly decrease the amount of liquid? 

put more bluntly, would the ""correct"" substitution in this case be: 

1 cup whole wheat flour --&gt; 1 and 1/3rd cup AP

Used 2lb of pie weights in parchment paper to keep it weighed down. Baked at 400°F for 10 minutes. Pulled it out and removed the weights. The bottom was insanely buttery. I haven't been able to taste the pie yet, but is this normal? I actually don't know as this is my first time blind baking.

Update: The pie still turned out pretty good, but I had a bit of a soggy bottom. I'll definitely go for a longer blind bake next time (maybe a lower temp as well?). Thanks for all the input!",t3_e0s5fv,imnotyoursharona,0

973,Need to improve/innovate on classic chocolate chip cookie recipe,"Hello everyone,

I like to bring baked goods in to work to share with coworkers and my cookies have earned me a reputation. The recipe I use is just this one:

     
    2 1/4 cups all purpose flour
    1 teaspoon baking soda
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
    3/4 cup brown sugar
    1/4 cup granulated sugar
    3.4 ounces vanilla instant pudding mix
    2 large eggs
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
     
    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
    In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda and salt and set aside.
    Using a stand or electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on high speed until light and creamy, at least 3 minutes. Do not skip this step. Once combined, add the pudding mix, vanilla and eggs and beat on high for 2-3 minutes.
    Slowly add half of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and turn the mixer on low to start so the flour doesn't get everywhere. Turn the mixer up to high and mix until combined. Add the rest of the dry ingredients and repeat until dough is just combined. Add chocolate chips and stir with a rubber spatula until incorporated.
    Drop cookies by 1/4 cup onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until slightly golden and just set on the top. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for two minutes then transfer to a baking rack to cool completely.

These are pudding cookies, with a packet of instant pudding mix added after creaming the butter and sugar. They usually come out very nicely, with good size, shape, and they don't fall flat at all. Beautiful cookies.

&amp;#x200B;

I've now been challenged by another engineer to have a ""cookie off"" and our coworkers will be judges. The only thing at stake here is my reputation. So I'm wondering if you guys can think of anything that might help this recipe produce the best cookies it can? Some things I've already thought of:

1. Use butter with higher fat content (kerrygold) (not sure if this will help or hurt when it comes to cookies, plan on experimenting today)
2. Use cage free eggs
3. King Arthur flour
4. Jello brand instant pudding mix (usually use store brand because cheaper)
5. Real vanilla extract (usually use artificial)

Also I plan on really paying attention to creaming the butter and sugar together for the appropriate amount of time (\~3 minutes?) and being sure not to overmix the dough.

TL;DR: what can I do to make these cookies the best they can be.

What do you guys think? Is there anything obvious here that I'm missing to improve on these cookies?",t3_e0067y,amantonas,0

977,Baking bread for Lyme disease,"Long one here, bear with me because I could use a little help from my fellow mad scientists on this. 

Someone I know has a fairly severe case of Lyme disease, and as such has been put on a very restricted diet. Her restrictions include being limited to only spelt or millet flours, and nothing with yeast. Yeast appears to be a complication because the antibiotics and other medications for Lyme disease can cause the person's digestive tract to be overrun with yeasts and fungus, and that in turn can have all manner of complications.

So here's me trying to make a half-way decent loaf of bread for her, and my first attempt was just a quick bread.
I tried a 100% spelt flour quick bread leavened with baking soda and acid (the acid in this case coming from an improvised buttermilk made of oat milk and lemon juice because she also isn't supposed to have real milk).
It was ok. Basically a bread, but unremarkable.

My concern with quick breads is that they don't really process the flours at all. The slow fermentation of a good sourdough bread is what makes flours so easily digestible, and friggin delicious. 

I can improve the flavoring and nutrition a little with some additions to the quick bread, like oats and maybe a little almond flour, but if anyone happens to have better ideas I would love to hear them. 

As a side-note, I'm not entirely clear why yeasted breads should be prohibited in this case. A well-baked loaf often comes out of the over near 100 C, maybe 205-210 F for the imperial folks, well beyond the 60 C (140 F) that is takes to pasteurize yeast. Does anyone with a medical or nutritional expertise know whether that really poses any health risks for someone in this condition?",t3_dymz17,Alndrienrohk,0

I'm in the US, so I've used almond flour, powdered sugar, and large egg whites. I'm baking this for a smaller crowd, so I've halved the recipe.

When I mixed 250g almond flour, 250g powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp almond extract, and two egg whites, the dough would not come together. It was crumbly-- I could squeeze a handful to make a turd-shaped log, but I couldn't roll it out at all. I stuck it in the fridge hoping the chill would help, but it did not.

It felt low on moisture, so I added another egg white, and got it so I could sorta pinch and roll it out. I did freestanding rings rather than use a mold because I didn't care toooo much about precision, but the dough was still very crumbly and hard to work with.

Here was the final product: https://imgur.com/ADYwdTj . It was still moist on the inside-- is that correct, texture-wise? I was worried that 10 minutes was not very long to bake them.

What went wrong to make the initial dough so dry? Are ground almonds distinct from almond flour? Are UK eggs bigger than US eggs?",t3_dyu06y,nicetiptoeingthere,0

When you said muffins are so moist, does it mean the mouthfeel is watery after a bite ? (this is how I understood moist)

I'm using buttermilk and 50% of white sugar (baker percentage). I take care to not overmix. I'm baking at very high temperature for the beginning and then reduce drastically. Maybe the high temperature burst is making my muffin not moist enough ?

The main potential issue I see with this, other than the high likelihood of the emulsion either not forming or breaking, is that there is a \*lot\* more protein. Like \~130g extra.  

I can't find any information on the effects of such an excess of protein in a recipe like this. Any thoughts on how it may affect the batter and the bake would be really appreciated!  

I'd also just love to hear any other ideas or tips for this little project. I'd like to hear thoughts on adding corn starch versus AP flour in cheesecakes, for example!

1025,Creme Patissiere Help: it turned to rubber in an instant,"As a follow up to my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/dqcmez/when_europeans_say_corn_flour_do_they_mean_corn/), I'm sad to report that my first attempt at creme patissiere resulted in failure.  I watched a tonne of YouTube videos and I confident that I had my technique down pat.  But I'll go over the recipe and steps I used, and I'd appreciate it if anyone can point out where I might have gone wrong

**RECIPE**

* 1 liter of whole milk
* 4 whole eggs
* 200g sugar
* 110g corn starch
* 1 whole vanilla pod

Recipe notes:  

* Most recipes just use egg yolks, but the one I followed used whole eggs.  Maybe the extra protein caused my coagulation problems?

* The recipe I followed used quite a bit of corn starch compared to other recipes I was looking at.  As an observation, recipes coming from French sources use a lot more corn starch than recipes coming from American sources.  Too much corn starch would also explain my coagulation problems.

**METHOD**

1) Heated milk, vanilla pod, and some sugar over medium heat (electric stovetop) in a heavy-bottomed stainless steel saucepan until it was just about boiling.  I whisked it the whole time, which I'm not sure if you are supposed to do.

2) Whisked together the sugar and corn starch.  Added that to my beaten eggs and whisked this mixture together.

3) Slowly added the hot milk mixture to the egg/sugar/starch mixture to temper the eggs.

4) Added the mix back to the original sauce pan that was on medium heat (electric stovetop).

5) Whisked the bejesus out of this mixture while it was heating up

6) Intended to wait for the pastry cream to come to a boil and then continue heating for 2 minutes before removing from heat and decanting to cool.

It's between steps 5 and 6 where everything went wrong.  As I was whisking the bejesus out of the pastry cream, its consistency changed to that of rubber in the span of about 3 seconds.  I've never seen this happen in any of the YouTube videos I've watched.

I've tried independently researching what might have gone wrong, but it seems that most problems with pastry cream is that it's too runny, or that it's too lumpy.  I wouldn't call mine lumpy per say, I'd call it rubbery.  If anyone has any insight or tips that might help, I'd appreciate it!",t3_dqp4ps,voodoochile78,0
1026,"When Europeans say ""Corn Flour"" do they mean Corn Starch (U.S.)?","I've been watching a lot of the Great British Bake Off and YouTube videos by french chefs and bakers.  They are always adding ""corn flour"" to their custards and pastry creams in order to thicken it up.  It looks like a very white powder.

However, in the U.S., ""corn flour"" aka masa harina is a yellow gritty substance that I assume was invented by the indigenous peoples of the southern U.S. and Mexico.  I can't see using that for creme patissiere, and can't really imagine the flow of trade between Mexico and France during the 18th century where French pastry chefs were importing masa harina to make their custards.

I just want to check, because this weekend I am going to make creme patissiere for the first time following the instructions of a frenchman who calls for ""corn flour"" in his recipe, and I intend to use corn starch for that.

one question I've had has to do with the beurrage. I understand its role in the laminated dough, but I'm not sure I understand why so much effort is spent to effectively mash up the butter before constructing it. is there a chemical reason for doing this? is it introducing more air into the block or something? redistributing the fat and water inside the butter?

He has two versions of tarte tatin--this is the newer one.

Why?  Because it seems like, since it's mostly apples and sugar, it might be interesting to try!  The problem is, there aren't any recipe references online--only that he cooks it for a very long time slowly, and that there's caramel involved.  

&amp;#x200B;

My first attempt was a bit of a fail, I think because I put too much caramel and the whole thing was inedibly sweet (and the apples got very hard in the process.)  I did layer the apples--and cook it at 250 degrees for 4 hours.  But I think the basting and adding of more sugars went too far.

1043,"An unconventional cheesecake - crust, thickening, bake vs no bake","Hey all! I'm planning a cheesecake for my girlfriend's dad's birthday in a couple weeks, and am stuck on a couple of technical issues.

He loves pies and cheesecakes, so I thought it'd be cool to wrap a cheesecake in a traditional hot water crust, with a lid and all.

I thought I could go about this a couple of different ways:

1. Blind bake my crust in a springform mold, pour a layer of no-bake cheesecake, chill, then a layer of strawberry compote, chill, another layer of no-bake, chill, a layer of blueberry compote, chill, one last layer of no-bake. I just tested a no-bake cheesecake I wasn't thrilled with texturally - it was a little too soft and I'm not confident it'll hold up to so many layers structurally. I could go about this in a couple of other ways: 

a. find another no-bake recipe that's a little more reliable. I've seen Stella Parks/BraveTart's recipe on Serious Eats. Do you all think that will give me the structure I need to pull this off?

b. If no, I can add a little agar to the recipe. I want it sliceable but not gelatinous. I was thinking of doubling [this recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/07/no-bake-cheesecake-recipe.html) and adding maybe a tablespoon of agar. Does anyone have thoughts on if it's a bad idea, whether or not it's enough, whether or not it's too much?

The second way I was thinking about this was just, well, baking it like a cheesecake. I haven't baked a cheesecake without a waterbath before, and I'm concerned that a waterbath + a liquidy filling won't exactly help the crust bake or brown. It's a lot of filling, so I'm concerned about baking it *without* a waterbath and just curdling the heck out of the filling. To add insult to injury, my home oven isn't exactly super reliable. I'd love it if it worked like a pate en croute, but I just can't visualize it happening.

I wish I'd had time to practice this, but unfortunately, life happened and I've got one shot to get it right. Worst case scenario, I'll throw the whole thing in the garbage and make him a quick pie, but...I'd love to see this work.

I have 2 days of class one week apart to make this.  I was going to make the tart dough the first week, then make the tart filling, a Swiss meringue and assemble it the second week.

1046,My shortbread came out too crumbly. Help please!,"Hello fellow bakers! 

I made my first ever batch of Millionaire's Shortbread Cookies two days ago and, while absolutely delicious, my shortbread came out super crumbly (it was my first time making shortbread too).  [I used this recipe to exact measurement, ](http://titlisbusykitchen.com/recipe/caramel-shortbread) but I only hand-worked my cookie dough until it came together and then pressed it into the bottom of the pan.

**ADVICE NEEDED: What can I do to make a stronger shortbread? More butter? Less flour? Work the dough longer? Different recipe? Any tips appreciated!**

P. s. It was my first time making caramel too, and the caramel I got from this recipe came out SO GOOD! I cooked it for 20 mins instead of 10 and I really liked the depth of flavor and color that came of it. I found it too sweet so I added a couple pinches of kosher salt and that helped.

Thank you in advance for any advice!

EDIT: The recipe-

Ingredients
For the shortbread:
250 g (9 oz) plain flour
175 g (6 oz) butter or margarine
75 g (2½ oz) caster sugar (or ordinary sugar)

For the caramel
400 g (14 oz) tin of condensed milk
150 g (5 oz) butter or margarine
150 g (5 oz) brown or white sugar

For the chocolate topping
200 g (7 oz) milk or plain chocolate.

Instructions
Prepare the shortbread base by mixing the flour and sugar in a bowl, then rubbing in the butter to produce a smooth paste-like dough.

Press the dough into an 8″x8″ (20cmx20cm) baking tin, or a Swiss Roll tin and smooth the surface with the back of a spoon.

Prick the dough with a fork and bake at 180°C for 20 minutes. Leave to cool in the tin.

Prepare the caramel by melting the butter gently in a pan. Add the sugar and stir until a “sludge” is formed.

Remove from the heat and stir in the condensed milk. Bring back to the boil and simmer gently with constant stirring for 8-10 minutes.

Pour the hot caramel onto the shortbread base, spread it out evenly then leave to cool completely.

Melt the chocolate in a glass bowl over a pan or boiling water. Pour onto the caramel and spread evenly. Place in the ‘fridge to harden the chocolate then cut into squares.

Titli's Tips

Don’t be tempted to cut into large squares! This is quite rich and is probably where the name Millionaires’ Shortbread comes from.

A deep tin helps to keep the edges neat until you are ready to cut it, but is not essential. Store in an airtight box in a cool place.",t3_do3nuw,invaderpenguin,0

1050,HELP cookies come out terribly wrong," 

Hi there!

My girlfriend and I attempted to make the cookies from the basics with babish episode on chocolate chip cookies. We followed the recipe exactly (or almost!) but our cookies came out terribly wrong!

Right when they go in the oven, the butter? starts seeping out of the cookies and spreading. Ultimately it never cooks through all the way and is very doughy even when over cooked for a long time (we tried again the next night after the dough was left in the fridge all night).

The only thing that may have been different is we converted flour from 11.5 ounces to just over 2 cups since we did not have a scale.... also we did not have a mixer so we mixed by hand but it was very very mixed up!

Could anyone please help us please! we want these cookies to be great!! We are guessing the flour... but if we try again with the exact right flour should these be better? Any other tips or tricks to watch out for when making these?

PS - what the hell is the correct conversion of flour from 11.5 ounces in volume?

**Method: Chocolate Chip Cookies**

1. **Start by browning 2 sticks of unsalted butter. Once brown, place in a measuring cup and refrigerate for 1 hour or until it’s re-solidified.**
2. **In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the butter along with ½ cup of white sugar and 1 ½ cups of brown sugar. Mix well to combine.**
3. **Next add 2 cold eggs to the mixture, and mix to combine.**
4. **In a separate medium bowl, whisk together 11 ½ ounces of all purpose flour, 1 Tbsp of kosher salt, ½ tsp of baking soda, and ¾ tsp of cinnamon.**
5. **Add half of dry ingredients to the stand mixer, mix to combine, and then add the other half of the dry ingredients. This helps keep your gluten down.**
6. **Add your chocolate chips, stir just until everything is well combined and remove dough from mixer. Place in a bowl and refrigerate for at least an hour or as long as 2 days.**

1064,How far in advance can you make sugar cookies,"Hello! I am hosting a big fall party in the next month or so and was going to be giving away sugar cookies as favors. Due to limited time I would like to make and decorate them as much as in advance as possible. 
I've played around with a few recipies and tricks and have yet to find the perfect way to save my sanity. Here is what I've done so far: 

Put them in the freezer uncooked for a week or two (in the various shapes) then baked 
Outcome: cookies needed more time / browned more. Flavor was altered a bit and became a bit crumbly. 

Baked them right away, then froze cooked (unfrosted) for a week - frosted later
Outcome: So far preferred, not too much changed for texture and taste. 

Baked and frosted within a day or two of each other
Outcome: Best tasting. Sanity lost.  Not sustainable. 

I'll be using royal icing for decorating, as it holds up the best. Any tips or tricks to make them last longer or how to make the best use of my time? Ideally I would love to have these 100% ready to go a week ahead of time... but at this point I'll take any time savers!",t3_dhx7o3,Doomishly,0

-------------------
I really like America's Test Kitchen blueberry jam swirl muffins, and I'm making banana bread for the first time and wanted to add a dark chocolate swirl the same way: add a small dollop to the top of the muffin and simply swirl it around a couple times with a chopstick to incorporate.  In the blueberry muffins, the jam incorporates well and adds a lot of flavor, without being noticeably distinct from the muffin, like an actual filling (such as in jelly doughnuts). 

What type of chocolate would be best this way? Does it matter? For example I don't know if just simply melted chocolate chips, or something like chocolate ganache, would be best. I would prefer a soft almost fudge-like addition instead of a chocolate that solidifies or stays runny. But I hardly ever do anything with chocolate more than using chocolate chips in cookies so I don't really know how to achieve that. I was also planning to add walnut pieces to the batter, and am using ATK's Ultimate Banana Bread [recipe](https://fortheloveofcooking.net/2017/01/ultimate-banana-bread.html) (non-paywall version), if it makes a difference.

1069,Non-dairy baking question,"Hey all

I was wondering if anyone could tell me why non-dairy baking turns out so much different than dairy recipes in that the non-dairy options do not brown as much as dairy options.

For example: French toast I find does not get that same golden yellow/light brown toasting colour when I use non-dairy. The second I make a batch using butter and milk, I instantly get that visual pop.

Same goes for muffins, I found that muffins required more time but it then risked the bottom which was already completely baked.

Without having any idea about the chemistry involved, would it have something to do with the higher fat content in dairy? Or am I just honestly screwing up the recipes somewhere.

It was really sticky after letting it rise for about ~20 hours -- IO had a hard time getting it out of the bowl it was rising in. So when I took it out to let it rest after trying to form a ball with it, it flatten out quite a bit and came out of the oven pretty flat. Is this a lack of flour? Something else?




&gt; 3 cups All purpose flour (not whole wheat - different ratios required for it to turn out properly with whole wheat due to gluten content)

&gt; 
&gt; After proving time, turn dough out onto a well floured surface and form a ball. No kneading required, just pull the edges towards the center a few times.

&gt; Rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place an oven safe baking dish with high sides into the oven and preheat to 450 degrees (I have a great oven-safe soup pot with a lid that works great for this).

I'm pretty new to baking (a few basic white loaves and dinner rolls under my belt), and I'm trying to start branching out with King Arthur's Hokkaido Milk Bread [Recipe](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/japanese-milk-bread-rolls-recipe)

I have made 3 attempts at it with all of them ending(beginning?) in the exact same way. The dough is thick, wet, and will not rise more than 10% after extended proofing and rising in a 73F-76F kitchen. My dough never turns into a strong, elastic, smooth ball. Heads up, I'm hand mixing and hand kneading. 

All of my ingredient amounts follow the recipe exactly, but here are differences in method:

**1st Attempt (lazy attempt):**  
-Made thick roux, put in last at room temperature.  
-put in instant yeast and salt at same time.  
-Put in cold milk a little early before beating egg and melting butter.  
-put in butter a little hot.  
-Mixed for 2-4 minutes; dough was a little spotty  
-kneaded for 3-5 minutes  
Result: throw out after proof  

**2nd Attempt:**  
-Made medium-thick roux, put in last at room temperature  
-mixed all liquids together and then put in when slightly warm  
-salt and instant yeast placed on opposite sides of the bowl  
-Mixed for 4-6 minutes; dough was consistent color throughout  
-kneaded for 10-15 minutes  
-Result: Cooked as dinner rolls. Thick and dense insides  

**3rd Attempt:**  
-Made medium-thick roux, put in last at room temperature  
-mixed all liquids together and then put in when slightly warm  
-salt and active yeast (4 tsp) placed on opposite sides of the bowl  
-Mixed for 4-6 minutes; dough was consistent color throughout  
-kneaded for 15-20 minutes

1088,KitchenAid mixer: Short attachments vs. small batches,"Hi everyone! After years of casual hand-mixing, I recently bought a KA Artisan Mini 3.5-qt tilt-head mixer.

The mixer itself works great, but there's something that's driving my OCD side insane: The attachments each reach significantly **different depths** in the bowl. The whisk is the only one that's perfect (barely clears the bottom); the **flex edge beater is quite short** by comparison, and the dough hook even more so.

Since I often bake for just myself in **small batches** (hence my choice of the 3.5-qt Mini), the short reach of the beater and hook results in **poor to no mixing at the bottom** of the bowl. I imagine this would be a non-issue with larger batches, since the attachments would get a good hold of the bulk of the dough, and the dough itself would pick up the rest.

Now, the manual says that if the attachments aren't at the ideal barely-clearing-the-bottom height, you should **adjust the head height**. I did, but this created two new problems:

1. When you turn the set screw clockwise to lower the head, you also create a gap between the head and the locking arm. **The more you lower the head**, the less the lock can hold it down, and **the more the head wobbles**.
2. Because the attachments are inconsistent in height, if I lower the head to make the beater perfect (which to me is the most critical), the whisk bottoms out.

Problem #1 is a deal breaker, since I can't have a wobbly head. I hate that the height adjustment has a direct effect on the locking mechanism, and that I **can't lower the head without also loosening the lock**. From the factory setting, the only true height adjustment one can make is upward, not downward, without ending up with a wobbly head.

It's a shame because, with the head slightly lowered, the beater works 100% perfectly for my needs: Not only does it mix all the way to the bottom, but the flex edge also better matches the curvature of the bowl, scraping the sides much better than at the factory height setting.

Short of making larger batches or going back to hand-mixing, is there either a hack you guys can recommend, or another brand of mixer whose attachments all reach the same depth or whose head can be lowered while staying tightly locked?",t3_de6jti,basteagow,0

They all turn out great, except for one aspect...they are just not attractive cakes lol. Here's my latest, the apple cake I made last night: https://imgur.com/a/E0CXnqz

They are very sticky and delicious, so I am hoping for ideas on how to make them look as good as they taste! I'm thinking on that one at least I should have layered more apples, it was mostly a flavor/timing test.

The main issue is that the topping isn't a standard brown sugar like with a pineapple upside down cake, it's actual caramel. I make that first, pour it into the pan before it hardens, layer the fruit, then the batter over that. When it comes out, at least some of the topping usually sticks to the pan; as you can tell from the image, the two middle slices of apple had to be scraped off and placed on the top. I also lose quite a lot of the caramel to the pan.

I don't grease the bottom of the pan, only the sides to get the cake out. I'm afraid of the fresh, piping hot caramel burning the butter/flour and ruining the cake. You can't let it cool first or it will harden and you'll never get it out of the pan you made it in.",t3_dc8ka1,Cymas,0

1104,Cookies Too Salty,"Hi all,

I felt like making Chris Morocco's cookie recipe after seeing people say great things about them. However, once I made them, the cookies tasted way too salty. Sometimes when I would take a bite, I would bite into a small salt chunk. I eventually realized that I used coarse salt that wasn't kosher, but rather meant for pickling/canning. But my question is, even though I used pickling coarse salt, why did the salt still not dissolve? And are the properties of pickling salt vs kosher salt that different? Just surprised that the cookies could taste that salty, as I only added 4g, which is what the recipe recommended. Thanks.

1106,"Brownies and electric oven, dried on top, too damp on the bottom","Hi everyone. I moved to a new apartment and am getting used to an electric oven instead of a gas one, and there is a steep learning curve, I am finding. 

I am trying to bake brownies with this recipe: https://www.goodlifeeats.com/recipe-exchange-simplest-homemade-brownies/

The first time I baked it, I baked on the lower side of the recipe for 25 minutes, then wrapped the top of the brownies in foil and put back in for five minutes. The issue was the top was well baked and actually ptobably overbaked, but the bottom was still underdone/undercooked. They dried out pretty easily and were much too cakey for my liking. I thought that maybe I didn't wait for them to cool enough, only two hours, and so I resovled to wait longer the next time.

The second time I just finished putting them in for 30 minutes, they looked perfect, and let them cool overnight, but I did wrap the top in tin foil before I went to bed. This morning they were looking great, but they were still kind of wet underneath and the ones in the middle were defintely undercooked on the bottom.

Any advice for this issue where they are baked/dried out on top but still underdone on the bottom with an electric oven? Should I have not wrapped them in tin foil overnight, this didn't allow enough moisture to escape the brownies with them wrapped up? Should the next time I try baking them take them out at a different time and then try wrapping them in tin foil?

I'd try wrapping them in tin foil from the beginning but I tried that with cornbread and it didn't cook right at all..

Things to note: oven rack is set lower to the bottom of the oven close to a heating grill and not close to the top, where there is another heating grill. I am following the recipe exactly, and I do want fudgey brownies but there is a line between fudgy and the bottoms still having some dampness to them and not being fully cooked in the middle.

1120,UPDATE: Swiss meringue buttercream not stiffening before adding butter,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/d4jzd1/swiss_meringue_buttercream_not_stiffening_before/

I thought I should give an update because many people were asking the same questions and also I've since realized my original post did not explain everything clearly. Big disclaimer, I mentioned in the first post that I'd moved to another city before I started failing at making swiss meringue, but that's actually not true because my first batch after moving was successful. 

So, during the first week of August, I made a nice batch of swiss meriengue buttercream (strawberry flavored), it was perfect, did not have ANY PROBLEMS.

Then 2 weeks later, I tried to make another batch of the exact same buttercream, with the exact same method. And FAILED.I dissolved 2:1 sugar and egg whites over a bain marie and then whipped the mixture till cold, then added the butter. 
This is the first instance where the egg whites and sugar mixture did not whip to stiff peaks no matter how long I mixed for. So I just added the butter anyway and ended up with the most liquidy buttercream I've ever made.

2 weeks after my first defeat I decided to try again. But again, the egg white and sugar mixture did not stiffen, it looked glossy like a meringue but stayed a liquid. I retried 4 times before I decided to make this post, the fixes I attempted were:
-After whipping mixture till room temp, put in fridge until cold to continue whipping
-Add more sugar to try and stiffen mixture
-Wipe everything down with vinegar &amp; refrigerate b4 using

I did not add butter to any of the 4 tries because I knew I'd just waste my butter making the world's liquidiest buttercream.
One of the comments in the original post mentioned that plastic holds fats and therefore you cannot use plastic equipment for swiss meringue buttercream. So I went and bought a stainless steel bowl to replace my plastic mixing bowl (which I've been using for the last 5 batches).
And I still failed.

At this point I think I'm more disappointed at myself than my father is and I don't know what else to try anymore. I ended up making american buttercream for my cake but it's just too sweet. 

So if anyone has any good advice, please do let me know. It is baffling how there was only 2 weeks between my last successful batch of buttercream &amp; my first failure.

I am using a hand-held mixer because I'm a broke student and it works since I'm only making small batches. And I've been making swiss meringue buttercream religiously for 5 years and never experienced anything like this.",t3_d7fnof,theyurgmerg,0

- Adding in an extra 1/4C Flour + 1/2tsp baking soda (per comments).

My boyfriend asked for a funfetti cake this year for his birthday. I was going to make a box cake like I've done at home (believe the brand for funfetti is Pillsbury?) and make homemade icing as usual, but heck. My boyfriend deserves a homemade cake!! So I'm going to make a funfetti cake from scratch. 

Was planning on using this recipe: https://preppykitchen.com/funfetti-cake-2/

My main question is... I was going to make the cake (recipe recommends you should do double recipe for an 8 inch round pan so thats what I'm doing) and I was going to split the cake into 3 layers. I'm probably overthinking this. I know that I can split the batter perfectly by weighing it into 3rds. But I only have one pan. Its a Fat Daddio 8-inch round (3 inch deep) pan.

So should I split up the batter and just bake each layer one at a time? I am worried about the batter getting too warm sitting on the counter or too cold sitting in the fridge.

They are crunchy, brown on the outside, and white on the inside, here are some pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/evrD5aa](https://imgur.com/a/evrD5aa) and [https://imgur.com/a/X8MXCPA](https://imgur.com/a/X8MXCPA) I really want to get this recipe down so I could make it myself. For my next attempt I was thinking of adding semolina flour to get the crunch down(although it's not on the bag's ingredient list), I'll paste the recipe below.  I will also paste the recipe that resulted in chewy rocks for reference. What do you guys think? Thanks in advance for your help!

My hopeful next attempt: 

* ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk, divided (the 2 Tbsp of milk is for brushing the kaak before baking)
* ½ tsp vanilla
* 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
* ¼ cup semolina flour
* pinch kosher salt
* 2 teaspoons yeast
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* ½ cup (4 oz.) unsalted butter, softened to cool room  temperature
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* Toasted sesame seeds for the tops

   

1. Line a sheet pan with parchment or a Silpat.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, salt, yeast, baking powder. Set aside.
3. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,  or a hand mixer, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 5  minutes. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in two  additions. Add the ¼ cup milk and combine until a soft, pliable dough  forms. The dough should not be sticky.
4. Shape the dough with your hands into rings, using about  2 tablespoons of dough per cookie (makes about 15 cookies). Gently move  the cookies to the baking sheet.
5. Brush the tops of each cookie with the 2 Tbsp of milk  and dip in sesame seeds.
6. Let the shaped unbaked cookie dough rest for four hours  uncovered.
7. Adjust the rack to the center of the oven and heat the  oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the cookies until they are golden brown, about  18 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool the cookies completely on a wire  rack. Keep the cookies in an airtight container for up to two weeks.

This recipe gave me chewy rocks:

Ingredients: 

&amp;#x200B;

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
* 1/3 cup of olive oil 
* 2/3 cup white sugar
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 
* 1 cup of toasted sesame seeds      
* Water to combine

Directions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Place the flour in a food  processor (or mixer); process a few seconds. Add the and baking soda; process to mix.
2. Add the vanilla extract and olive  oil through the feed tube; process a minute or so until the oil is no  longer visible and the dough is sandy in texture; add the brown sugar  through the feed tube and process until the dough leaves the sides of the  bowl and clumps, a couple or so minutes more. 
3. Gather the dough: It should  be moist, firm and compact. Pinch off small pieces and form into a small   sausage shape, rolling it back and forth till it reaches 4 inches in length. Bring the two ends together to form a ring. Dip the ring in the   sesame seeds. Place the cookies in a baking sheet lined with paper or  silicon mat. Bake for 15 minutes at 325F or until the cookies feel dry.  They will be extra-crispy as they cool. Store in a tight container for up      to 7 days. (They won’t last seven days).",t3_d2rjnz,DefiantCelebration,0

1146,Choux pastry deflated after baking,"Last week I tried making my own eclairs with choux pastry. They were pretty good, despite my piping newbiness. They came out lovely golden brown and nicely puffed out. However, the choux pastry completely deflated after the baking. 
According to a bit of research, it might be a bit of moisture left within...

I &gt;think&lt; I might solve this by just baking it for a longer time.
Is there a point where a choux can get too dried out (asside from obvious burning)? 

I'd really like to try making new eclairs, so I hope just baking them for longer will do the trick. Unfortunately, my oven is terrible and can't get warmer than I did during that bake (170°C - recipe recommended 180°C), nor can I open the door a crack when it's on.

I have been thinking of trying to make puff pastry for a while, but I have some doubts about the process.

1. Type of flour
My first question is about the flour used in the détrempe. 
Some recipes suggest a strong flour, some a mix of 00 flour and manitoba and other a weak flour.
I found different opinions and reasons about the use of each flour, so I'm quite lost.

2. Butter in the détrempe and flour in the butter
I knew the détrempe was made with just cold water, flour and salt, but some recipes add melted butter into it.
Do I have to add butter to the détrempe or not?
And finally, do I need to add flour to room temperature butter before putting it in the détrempe?

1166,Doughs always too wet,"I posted a while back that I was having trouble with my doughs not coming together /clearing the sides of the bowl in my mixer. The suggestion was to get my mixer calibrated, which I did, but I didn't really do any baking over the summer because it heats up the house too much. Fast forward to today... and the problem isn't fixed. 

I measured my flour to the precise tenth of an ounce, carefully measured my wet ingredients, etc. The dough was supposed to go on med-low speed until it cleared the bowl (appx 8 minutes, so said the recipe), then knead by hand for about 30 seconds until it formed a ball.

After 8 minutes, it was practically a batter. I added about 1/4 cup of flour and let it go for another two minutes. That didn't really help matters, so I decided to go to hand kneading. After several minutes and at least another 1/4 cup flour, it was no closer to forming a ball.

I did double the recipe, but it was a really small one to begin with. The doubled recipe called for 20 oz flour, 1 cup water, 2 egg yolks, and 2/3 cup yogurt. Is the hydration off, or was it something I did, or maybe my equipment? I'm so frustrated with this... I used to be so good at baking bread.",t3_czbcfq,dealea86,0
1167,"I'm making some bread from scratch, and want to fill it with meat. I don't know when to do this","Hello, new baker here. I was recommended to bake bread out of Flour Water Salt Yeast, I got all of the stuff and ingredients and it worked very well. Basically the recipe I want to use has me do this

1. combine flour and water, mix, rest for 30min
2. mix in salt and yeast, then let the dough rise for like 5 hours
3. fold it a few times while it is rising
4. divide it, shape it into bread, put the balls into a proofing basket for 1.25 hours
5. bake it

So I'm seeing in a lot of recipes for this (the ground meat it chorizo by the way) to flatten the dough, and then roll the cooked meat into it. When would I do this, before the proofing? also how can I proof it into a shape other than a big massive ball?

I also was baking the bread in a dutch oven. Should I still do this for the recipe? The last bread had a really hard crust, which was nice, but made it very hard to cut which would potentially be a problem if it's stuffed with meat.

1168,What went wrong with my french buttercream?,"I'll try to be as detailed as possible since i know a lot can go wrong with the egg based buttercreams. I attempted making the Alton Brown french buttercream recipe today (1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup dark corn syrup ((I subbed with a 3/1 ratio of light corn syrup and molasses)) 3 large eggs, and 10 oz butter)

I made sure to really get my sugar/syrup mixture to a good rolling boil and my eggs quite foamy before I slowly poured the mixture in using a greased measuring cup. I did not check the temperature at any point, but i did let the mixture come to a rolling boil with large bubbles. I did notice the mixture starting to thicken toward the end of my adding it to the eggs, but by then it was too late and the mix looked ok. 

As soon as the outsides of my metal mixing bowl had completely cooled to touch (room temperature) I started slowly adding butter. All the air was knocked out of the mix by my second piece of butter, so I stopped what i was doing and put the remaining butter in the friends for a few minutes. I then continued everything until the end product was a smooth, if soft buttercream. I stored it in the fridge and made my cakes. there were some sugar syrup remnants in the base of my bowl.

Just now, after letting my cakes cool an extra long time to be doubly sure they were cool, I went to re beat my frosting (straight from the fridge) and it immediately curdled. I kept beating, and in a minute or two it came together so I stopped beating and began frosting my cakes. the stuff went soft and melty almost immediately to the point where i stopped everything and threw my cakes in the fridge. It wasn't the temp of the cakes, even the frosting in my bowl turned to soup. The total time it spent outside the fridge was easily under 10 minutes. Luckily this cake was solely for me to experiment with french buttercream and I still plan to eat it.

I've never seen a buttercream go from too cold/curdled to completely melted so fast. Did I destabilize something? Was it a bad recipe? My thermostat is set at 72F and my apartment is closer to 70F right now. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.",t3_cyum5k,BookishWench,0

So easy right? Wrong. 
The recipe called for 12 egg whites or 2 cups. I ended up cracking 12 egg whites; it measured as less than two cups so I used two more eggs. The volume almost tripled to a point where it was overflowing out of the large bowl I used when I added the flour.

I cooled the cake upside down as indicated in the recipe but it was still collapsed in the middle after it was completely cooled. The texture and taste were still great.

I have tried making the above recipe twice so far. At first I thought the leavening method in step 7 was a bit strange, but I tried it anyway. The cake didn't rise at all, and came out of the oven very deflated. I liked the flavor though, so I tried making it again. In the second iteration, I tried adding the baking soda with the flour, and still adding the vinegar at the end. It didn't deflate per se, but it didn't rise to form a dome shape like I expected it to. What can I do to adjust this? Do I have to change the timing of the baking soda and vinegar? Will switching out the ap flour with cake flour have a positive effect?

On a side note - the color of the cake appears to be in between red and brown, and isn't really the bright red that I want. Should I add more food coloring or will helping it rise help the color as well?",t3_cvj0hw,kiptroti,0

1186,"Storing cookie dough, using bigger mixers etc..?","Hi! Long story short, I'm opening a cookie shop without prior bakery experience and would love tips. These are some random things on my mind but I could use any general info you've got!  

* My dough is often refrigerated overnight. I shape the cookies, wrap in plastic wrap and put them in rows in 2.5 gallon ziplock bags. That does a good job of keeping the dough exterior from drying out but not exactly practical on a larger scale. How would it be done in a bakery? 
* Tips for storing large amounts of ingredients? Anything that makes your job easier? I saw someone mention cutting flour bags underneath so it doesn't go everywhere when putting into a storage bin. Things like that!
* Tips for using larger mixers? I have 5qt, 6qt, 8 qt and 20qt. I've never used the 20 qt but felt like the 8 qt slowed me down..as in I could make 2 6qt batches in the same amount of time. Should I be allowing the flour to mix a little longer as the batch size increases to make sure it's incorporated? Anything that makes working with big mixers easier?

I love baking cakes that have a layer of fruit in them. Ive tried 5 or 6 different recipes now for homemade fruit filling and so far none have quite been the consistency im looking for. Someone on a baking forum suggest using a ""pate de fruit"" recipe and cooking just shy of being done, poor thin layer into a cake pan to let set, then use that as the ""fruit filling"". The recipe seems practical enough for me to attempt but being that ive never hsd any schooling nor to my knowledge ever really eaten a ""pate de fruit"" candy i dont quite know the consistency or how it would work in addition to the cake. 

I plan on doing a 'strawberries and cream' cake with strawberry cake layers, a layer of vanilla bean curd and strawberry ...something fillimg in between lol and then a buttercream frosting. 

Ive used gelatin to thicken jam before and that was probably the closest to the consistency i was hoping for, been reading about pectin and wondered if it may get just a bit thicker without being ""chewey"". This is how the ""pate de fruit"" recipe csme up.

1205,General Guidelines for Rolling Out Laminated Dough ?,"As an amateur home baker, I’ve found most recipes give specific rollout size instructions, such as for croissants. I’ve had good luck with making laminated dough (and croissants using Weekend Bakery’s recipe), but I would like to use the dough for other viennoiseries as well. Are there any general guidelines as to what size/thickness to roll out laminated dough to in order to make various pastries - croissants, pain aux raisins, danish, etc - that might scale from small batch and up?

For example, the Weekend Bakery croissant recipe has a laminated block (after three turns) about 22x14cm, and directs it to be rolled out to 20 x 100cm for croissant cutting. A different pain aux raisin recipe I have used says to roll out to 60x33cm and then roll it up to create a 51cm log, cutting x20 2.5cm portions. It’s a bit difficult to reconcile the differences between the various recipes, so any general guidelines would be great, especially in relation to thickness (recipes never seem to give that). Ultimately, it would be great to have enough understanding of any general guidelines here to be able to split the dough, and roll half out for croissants and half for pain aux raisins or danish.

Slightly off-topic additional questions:

Does anyone have any experience using a baking steel in the oven with viennoiseries? Either to just conduct heat at the bottom or to actually bake on (either directly or on a baking sheet placed directly on the steel)? I’m not sure if this would improve the bake/oven spring in a home oven by intensifying the bottom heat, or just make things worse?

So I tried making honey crullers following the above recipe but they smelt very heavily of eggs and I couldn't bear to eat them. 

Based on this recipe and others, I realized the crullers are just fried choux pastry. The instructions on making the choux pastry weren't the best but I just followed the typical procedure for choux, making sure to add the flour quickly, drying it out as much as I could and then adding in eggs one at a time and letting the dough sort of come together before adding the next egg. The only mistake I made here is I added in 2 eggs at once at the beggining. I don't think that could have caused the stink though, it just took forever for the dough to come together.

I did leave the choux sitting on the counter for like 15-20 minutes while I was having my dinner, and then refigerated it for another half hour before piping it and frying it in the oil which was around 370 F. I'm not sure if leaving it out might have been responsible for the eggy taste? It wasn't hot in my kitchen at all.",t3_cr21kg,humbleharbinger,0

I was considering using coarsely chopped macadamia nuts or pecans.
* For the ""purple stuff"" in the middle, I'm torn between some kind of blueberry mousse/gelatin, or a stiffened blueberry cream cheese frosting. 
* For the topping, I was going to attempt a salted caramel sauce whipped into a caramel buttercream and then pipe it on.
* For the horns, I won't have time for a meringue or molded chocolate that takes more than 4-6 hours to set. So to lighten up the cake flavors I was going to make lemon poppy seed shortbread cookies shaped into horns and frosted/colored with whatever I use for the middle.
* Do you think all these flavors and textures will work together? Rich chocolate sponge, creamy or fluffy blueberry, creamy caramel and lemon poppy seed?

It is the same for European and American style butters.  I have tried softening the butter and pressing it into a makeshift mold and get the same problem because it clearly loses its malleability.

I am a very amateur baker and I am planning on making a chocolate cake for my anniversary. I am struggling to find a recipe that I like. I am going for a two layer chocolate cake with strawberry filling in between the layers and chocolate frosting. Right now I am between two very similar recipes with a few differences.

I’m not a professional, by any means, but I have been baking for over 15 years and made a couple wedding cakes and plan on making my own wedding cake next years too. I bake sourdough successfully and lots of other things! It’s my jam! I bake to relax! So! I’ve been commissioned to make a chocolate birthday cake. Easy peasy. Traditional chocolate cake. Whipped caramel ganache filling. Chocolate Swiss meringue buttercream. A chocolate drizzle and some crunchy coffee cocoa bits for texture. Planning two or three layers. No problem. 

I decide to try a new cake recipe (I know. My first mistake) because I was intrigued and, come on... I can make this work. But I can’t. I made the recipe first time. Underbaked. SO underbaked. I thought. I used a skewer to test. It was springing back in the center when i touched it. It was past the time thenrecipe said. Let layers cool. Decide to trim the top a bit (to get a taste 😂) gummy. Seemed not baked. Soooo dense. Ew. Ok. Try again. So I halved the recipe and tried just baking one layer. It SEEMED to come out ok. I left it in for almost 10 minutes longer than the last one. Still showed all the signs of being done. Let it cool. Sliced the top. It seemed better. So I decided to bake two more layers, but one at a time. They cooled and i was skeptical because they just were slumping and looked kinda weird so, in still being able to use them if they were good, I trim it a little to get a taste. They. Were. Awful. Same gummy seemed underbaked, but how?! They were in so long. I followed the recipe. I’m familiar with my oven and know it’s temp. What the heck is wrong with me or what is up with this weird recipe that clearly looks delicious?! I’ve now got five layers of cake in my trash (my husband spit out a piece of cake I offered. Spit it out. My husband. It was bad, you guys.) and no layers of cake for my commissioned birthday cake 

Almost gonna buy some box mixes out of frustration. Husband and mother (who I texted on the other side of the country for comfort) both convinced me to just make a normal Cale recipe I’m familiar with. Even though I think I’d be totally fine with some boxes gussied up at this point. And so the baking continues today. Recipe link below.

1249,tips for using my Hobart N50,"Hi all! This is my first question to AskBaking. After my Kitchenaid stand mixer stripped a gear while kneading a double batch of challah dough, I got a used Hobart N50 which handles the load like a total champ. However, one thing I hadn't realized when I got the Hobart was that the end of the beater is quite far from the bottom of the bowl, such that it won't mix single batches of, well, anything. I'm wondering if you expert bakers know how to mitigate this and if there there's any other tricks and tips you've accumulated on how to best use the N50. Grateful for any knowledge you can impart!

EDIT: In the far-off chance someone actually references this thread in the future... it turns out that I somehow got an extra-deep bowl with my N50 which stands 7+1/2"" tall, whereas the online N50 specs show the regular bowl stands 6+15/16"" tall.

I have this idea for a cake, it’s for a baby shower. I’ve never done this however, and I haven’t seen this as a thing that exists already, but it certainly may!

In my head, this will give me a neat color effect where the ruffles will almost look backlit with pink (?) but will still be white.

1274,Gold standard for measuring flour is by weight. How would one know if the original recipe followed this method?,"I recently made these [cookies](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/11246-vegan-chocolate-chip-cookies). It called for 2 cups of all purpose flour. 
I know 1 cup of flour is 120g, so I measured for 2 cups, or 240g of flour. 
The [dough was on the wetter/oily side](https://imgur.com/a/JHBapFN), but I figured it's a vegan recipe so might be different from non-vegan cookie dough. [Cookies were a bit on the oily side](https://imgur.com/a/JHBapFN), not exactly what it looks like in the picture, regardless tasted great. 

I look at the recipe again, and notice that it calls for 2 cups *(10 ounces)* of ap flour. 

But

1 cup = 4.25oz 

2 cups = 8.25oz

8.25 =/= 10oz

I'd say the cookies could've used the extra 1.75oz.

Why is there this discrepancy? 

But most of all, it got me thinking how off you can be with measuring despite measuring ""correctly"". Who knows how recipe blogs or old recipe books measured their flours, etc.. You'll never know the *exact* recipe of anything. 

Well I guess I basically answered my own question through my post... Though I'd love your thoughts, /r/askbaking.",t3_cel7j1,alphalpha_particle,0

The bread seems a little heavy and I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing wrong. We have a great bloom in the yeast before adding the flour, but I'm extremely inexperienced when it comes to baking.

1278,How to stop my dough from being too springy?,"My bread often comes out nice and tasty, but I keep having problems when it comes to the shaping stage. My usual routine is to mix the ingredients for the dough together loosely, leave it for half and hour, and then mix it with a dough hook on a hand-mixer for around eight minutes or so. I then take it out of the bowl, oil it, put it back in and leave it to rise overnight in the fridge. I then bake it in the morning by taking it out (I've tried taking it out and leaving it for an hour to get back up to room temperature too), knocking the air out by folding the dough in on itself and then trying to shape it before going in the oven.

I can get an okay sort of boule shape, but whenever I try to follow my recipe book's guide on shaping I just can't get the dough to behave itself. It says I need to shape it into a rough rectangle, before folding the two sides into the middle and rolling it up. The problem is is that I can barely stretch the dough at all because it just springs back, and if I use too much force it simply tears. It just feels like it doesn't want to change shape at all.

Does anyone have any advice for where I'm going wrong or what I can do to make the dough a little more malleable and shapeable? I've had this problem with simple white dough, wholemeal dough and a few other doughs that are a mixture of different flours.",t3_ccnusv,hoteldybbuk,0

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently looking for some protective arm sleeve for another baker.  They've already burnt their forearm from a hot tray in the past and I don't want to happen again as their workplace does not provide protective arm sleeves.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I've done some shopping and a tiny bit of research on the materials used for the products I found.   As of now, I've purchased a pair of [black kevlar protective arm sleeves](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B077YK66HN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) (linked for your convenience).

&amp;#x200B;

I found that the arm sleeves I bought performed as expected and they fit me just well, but I'm afraid that they're rather large for the person I'm buying them for.  I'm sure there will be other things that will cause some discomfort, such as increased heat and humidity from prolonged wear, and potential slipping.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here I am.  Wondering if there are any arm sleeves that may be more eye catching and more comfortable for prolonged wear.  


\-------------

EDIT:   
Thank you for the replies!  

  
I've come to the conclusion that I should probably just stick to the kevlar arm sleeves I purchased and hope they fit my baker.  Instead of looking for an attractive sleeve, I think the best option is to obtain another ""inner"" arm sleeve to help prevent chaffing (as suggested by /u/Deadpoolssistersarah).",t3_cbzt3t,tillsmal,0

Please help as this is the best tasting recipe I have found and although I've had other issues in the past, none this bad.  Recipe below.

Onion Rye Bread-

2 1/2 cup bread or all purpose flour (approx)

1 1/2 cup rye flour, stone ground preferred 

2 Tbsp sugar

2 tsp salt

1 package dry yeast

1 cup milk, room temp

1/2 cup hot water (120-130 degrees F)

2 Tbsp vegetable oil

3/4 cup finely chopped onion

2 Tbsp caraway seeds

1 egg beaten, mixed with 1 Tbsp cream and 2 tsp water

Process:

Mix 1 1/2 cup white flour with 1/2 cup rye flour, the sugar, salt, and yeast.  Make a well and pour in milk, water, and oil.  Mix to make a thick batter, add chopped onion and caraway seeds.  

Stir in the remaining 1 cup rye flour and add the remaining white flour 1/4 cup at a time to make a mass that can be lifted from the bowl.

Turn dough onto flour work surface and kneed aggressively for around 8-10 minutes.  Place in oiled bowl to double in size.  

Punch down, form ball and let rest 3-4 minutes.  Form to fit bread pan, then cover and let double in volume.

Brush top with egg-cream wash.

Bake @ 375F 30-40 minutes.  Turn out and test for doneness.  If needed, return to oven for 10 minutes out of pan.

Cool on wire racks.

The thing that gets me though is that the juice from the strawberries leaked out the air hole I cut in the tops. On some pastries it even came out the crimped sides. I can't for the life of me figure out why though, I used fresh strawberries. 
Do I need to cook out the excess water in the strawberries first to do this? 
I did cut the strawberries up at least 1 hour before mixing them with cornstarch and sugar and then put them back in the fridge if that makes a difference. I know it doesn't change the taste quality but I do want to at least get them looking well enough to present at parties and such.

1330,Browning Butter,"I have been trying to nail down BA's best chocolate chip recipe [(LINK)](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-chocolate-chip-cookies).

The recipe calls for browning the butter, 1 ^(1/2)  Sticks (^(3/4) Cup)

The first time I made it I browned enough butter to have ^(3/4) cup of melted brown butter, which resulted in overly greasy buttery cookies. I did a little googling and found that browned butter should be about ^(3/4) of the original butter since the water has evaporated. So from this I assumed that browning 1 ^(1/2)  Sticks (^(3/4) Cup) butter should result in ^(1/2) cup of browned butter for the final recipe. 

Except when I went to brown my butter, I ended up with roughly the same measurement I started out with. I didn't want to end up having the same problem as before so I used about half a cup of the browned butter and the cookies tasted better than the first attempt. 

My question is how much butter am I supposed to be using for the recipe after browning, is it the full ^(3/4) of a cup - or the reduced amount of ^(1/2) cup? 

And second, why didn't my butter reduce in volume? Did i not cook it long enough for the water to evaporate - even though it had developed a nice amber colour and nutty aroma? I was scared of burning so I assumed it was done, should I have let it cook some more?

1344,Differences baking in a gas oven vs an electric?,"All my life until the past few years, I had an electric stove and oven which produced consistent results when baking. I made chocolate chip cookies (classic Toll House recipe) that always came out well, even though I measured using measuring cups.

Now that I'm living in another country, I don't have access to an electric oven. Most people here use gas stove and oven combos, which is what I have. We also don't have a gas main, so this range is connected to a propane tank. I really don't like it but would basically have to remodel my entire kitchen to change the setup and convince 70% of my building neighbors to agree to install gas lines just so I could have a gas cooktop and a separate electric oven (the dream).

My oven is controlled with a simple dial and no digital display, which makes it hard to get an exact temp. I bought an oven thermometer, and have noticed 2 things:

1) it takes much longer to preheat this oven than an electric oven

2) it doesn't seem to regulate temperature well, as once my thermometer indicates it's at the dial temp the temperature just keeps rising past it anyway.

Because of these things, even though I measure my ingredients with a scale now and use the same recipe, my results are really inconsistent. Some days I get cookies that spread really thin and run into each other, and others I get stiffer cookies that seem to take forever to bake.

Is there a difference in gas ovens I need to account for? How is baking different with different types of ovens? Another thing to note is that my environment is consistently very humid in my new country, whereas back home it varied.",t3_c0m156,KnottilyMessy,0

I decided to give regular banana bread another shot today and made sure I had ample time to bake longer than the recipe called for. 

The recipe I made was [this one](https://thesaltymarshmallow.com/best-banana-bread-recipe/) with the following changes: 

- 75g White Sugar &amp; 125g Dark Brown Sugar (instead of 1C white sugar)
- 1 tsp cinnamon (instead of 1/2tsp)
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg (added)
- 65g Walnuts (added)
- 2 tbsp turbinado sugar (added to top)

The bread flavor is great! I've cut into it while it's still hot, so of course it's a bit crumbly, but it tastes great. There's just one problem...

The edges are just a *little* bitter! I wouldn't call them burnt, but the taste is slightly noticeable. It's just the sides and bottom of the bread; the top is fine and it is cooked through -- though it probably could have safely taken another 5 minutes just to fluff and dry it up a bit more.

I measured the temperature of my bread and pulled it when the internal temperature was around 195°F. This meant that I baked the bread for 60 minutes initially, then for another 15 minutes after that to reach the appropriate temperature. The total bake time was 75 minutes at 350°F on the center rack of my oven. I used a copper (coated?) 9x5 pan that I bought from Walmart.

1372,Brown top cheesecake = overbaked?,"Hi! This might be a dumb question but I was just wondering if my cheesecake is okay to serve. 

This is my second time baking a cheesecake using the same recipe and for some reason, the top of my cheesecake was getting brown really quick. I think it was about at 15 minutes when my boyfriend turned off the oven saying it was too hot and that's why it was browning. He's a chef so I trusted his judgement and left the cheesecake inside the oven for the remaining 15 minutes. After that, I continued following my recipe and took out the cheesecake and let it cool in the bain marie to room temperature. Thankfully, no cracks! But the top of my cheesecake is pretty brown.

Do you think my cheesecake is cooked all the way even though I didn't bake it for as long as the recipe called? I'm serving it today to my boyfriend's friends and I don't want to give them an uncooked cheesecake. 

I would have done a toothpick test but I was baking really late at night and ended up falling asleep so I just wrapped it up and popped it in the fridge. Also, I think my pan might have leaked as it felt a little heavy as I was putting it in the fridge...",t3_bx50p6,RiceCrispix,0
1373,Making chocolates,"Hello everyone!

This isn’t necessarily baking but since I want to use the chocolates as decor, it might qualify as such. 

Thing is, I have failed a few attempts to make my own chocolates over the past days. I want them to be filled, so I started to melt some choc and coated the outsides of my silicon chocolate tray and let them cool. Then I applied the filling (a caramel sauce and some peanut cream) and coated it with chocolate to close it; once, I poured the chocolate right on the filling, the other time I let the filling cool down first. I waited the night and they are all stiff and firm, but I can’t get them out of the tray. Sometimes the outside chocolate layer is too thin and it breaks and other times the final chocolate layer just peels of and the rest is still stuck in the tray. From four attempts, I got like 8 okayish chocolates. 

Is there a trick to it? Am I doing something terribly wrong? Any advice would be appreciated.

1374,How much should I pay my friend for making me a dozen cupcakes?,"Edit: So this is what I'm thinking. I've already talked to her about her making me cupcakes and me wanting to pay her for it. Now, I'll wait until she gives me an update on when it's done or whatever. Then I'll ask her what she thinks for the price. And if she low balls her self, I'll say, ""Well, I was actually thinking about $40."" If she gives a fair price, then I'll just agree. Does that sound like the least awkward option?


So my friend is an amazing baker and she's never been paid for her baked goods. I thought I'd commission her to make some cupcakes for my neighbor and she agreed. So we agreed for a dozen cupcakes.


I was thinking of paying her somewhere between $2.50 - $3.50 per cupcake (we live in Michigan, USA for context.


Does that price sound okay? Also, how do I bring this up to her? Like I told her I wanted to pay her, but do I tell her how much I want to pay her or should I ask her how much she wants?

1382,Grandpa's Sweet Bread,"Hi, 
The following is my Grandpa’s sweet bread recipe. The ingredient amounts listed are approximates, as he made everything by feel. (I’m guessing that some of these amounts may be incorrect.) I’ve tried making this recipe multiple times; the finished product tastes like his bread (in terms of sugar), but the texture of the bread is always too dense. Could this be due to incorrect recipe ratios? Recipe methods? Am I handling the dough incorrectly? Any thoughts about how to lighten the texture would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Grandpa’s Sweet Bread

Yield: 2 loaves

Ingredients 

Bread:

* 3 cups Gold Medal All-Purpose flour, divided
* 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 egg, beaten
* 3 tablespoons Crisco
* 1 teaspoon salt
* olive oil
* egg wash

Yeast mixture:

* 1/4 cup water
* 2 1/4 teaspoons Fleischmann’s Active Dry yeast
* 1 teaspoon sugar

Directions 

* Make a well out of 1.5 C. flour. Add the following: 1/2 C. + 2 tblsp. sugar, egg, and Crisco. Pour salt on top of the well.
* Make a second well out of the remaining 1.5 C. flour.
* Heat water to 105 degrees F. Dissolve 1 packet of yeast into the warm water and then stir in 1 tsp. sugar. Let mixture proof for 10 mins.
* Add yeast mixture to second well.
* Mix contents of both wells together. Add additional warm water, if necessary.
* Knead dough until smooth. (Instead, I’ve been using a dough hook/electric mixer for this step; I can never get dough to clear sides of bowl; instead, I use widowpane test. I needed additional 3 tablespoons of flour to achieve windowpane.)
* Rub top of dough with olive oil and then place in a metal bowl, also coated with olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap, and place bowl in a warm area for 45 mins., or until dough doubles in size. (Instead, I’ve been using a proofing box set to 75 degrees F, and let dough rest for 2 hours.)
* Punch down dough and knead for a few minutes. Let dough rise again for another 45 mins., or until it doubles in size. (Instead, I placed dough in proofing box and let rise for another hour.)
* Cut dough into 2 pieces.
* Divide each piece of dough into 3 pieces. Roll each piece into a long strip. Braid 3 strips together to make one loaf (this recipe yields 2 loaves).
* Place braids onto a cookie sheet covered with Silpat. Let braids sit for another 45 mins., or until they double in size. (Instead, I placed in proofing box for another 45 minutes.)
* Warm oven to 350 degrees F.
* Brush each braid with egg wash. Place cookie sheet onto top rack of oven. Cook for 20 mins. Check bread. If not ready, cook for another 10-15 mins. until top is golden brown.",t3_bvd3c0,Champ321,0

I've narrowed it down to two people, neither of which fessing up, but that's beside the point.

1393,"Professional Bakers of Reddit, How Did You Get Into Baking as a Career? Career Advice Thread","Hello, r/AskBaking!  I'm considering drastically shifting my career path towards the culinary arts by way of baking and I was hoping others on here would have some advice or personal stories on how to break into the field.  I'm in the US (SoCal) so there's no shortage of bakeries and markets in my area.  My current work is relatively flexible on hours as well.

Some questions:

* I've been told that if I don't want to go back to school for culinary, my best shot is to try ""staging"" (procnounced ""stahjing"" I'm told?) as an apprentice at a bakery for X months, likely in an unpaid internship status, to learn basic techniques the right way.  So is this setup usually only done at independent bakeries, or will modern grocery stores and restaurants know what I'm talking about if I inquire about staging there?
* OTOH, if you have experience doing culinary school in your late 20's or beyond I want to hear about that experience too, and if it was a correct choice for you.
* Without any culinary experience other than a coffee shop serving job and a bagel shop sandwich maker in college, is it appropriate to apply for entry level positions at bakeries and ALSO mention staging in the same cover letter for a paid job?  Or will hiring managers generally be scared away by employment law confusion etc.
* Is it still appropriate to go in in person FIRST to introduce myself to a head baker and inquire about staging in person out of the blue?  Or should I be sending a resume to the hiring managers.

A bit about me, I'm 30 y.o., who has worked in the non-profit sector for most of my 20's and became seriously disillusioned by the ""work to make a difference"" culture of long hours on ""an activist's salary,"" mentality of that entire sector.  I'm fine with a modest income, but not minimum wage at a 60+ hrs a week position.  As I came to dislike my work more and more, gardening and cooking (especially baking) became my main outlets for stress relief to the point where I'd make food just to give away to impress others.  I've come to suspect that making food could be the thing I always should have pursued professionally, and was always just too pre-occupied by family and educational stresses to seriously consider doing it for a paycheck.  I've taught myself many many of the basics from cookbooks and websites but have limited experience in foodservice jobs, all from 8+ years back.

I'm hoping you guys might be able to help me troubleshoot a few issues with the recipe so I am better prepared next time! [This](https://domesticgothess.com/blog/2016/04/22/smores-eclairs/) is the recipe I used. As an aside, I did measure all of my ingredients by weight.

**Issues**

- My creme patissiere never came to a boil while cooking, but did get *incredibly* thick. Although it wasn't boiling, once it became thick I started the 'two minute' timer. It was so thick I struggled to mix it and had to recruit my boyfriend to do it. Straight out of the fridge, it was too thick to pipe. Even after microwaving, piping it was extremely difficult. Even at room temperature, it was more of a custard than a cream. **What made the pastry cream so thick?**

- I ultimately had to use 4.5 eggs to get my choux pastry to a texture even vaguely like what I had seen online in videos. It was still potentially a bit thick, but I was able to get a decently long ribbon out of it at that point and it held it's shape well (and was easy to pipe). **Is it correct to assume I had to use more eggs due to regional differences?**

- I overshot the size of my eclairs a bit and they were probably closer to 13cm than 12cm. However, during baking they really barely colored at all. I gave them an extra 5 minutes (35 minutes instead of 25-30) until they started to color, but they were only golden on top, around the craquelin. During cooling, I cracked the oven door (I saw many recipes online suggest this) and cooled them for around 25 minutes. While cooling, they completely collapsed. **What happened to make my eclairs collapse and/or how can I keep it from happening next time?** (Note: This was the biggest issue by far as it made my eclairs unusable.)

1414,Chocolate chip cookie recipes always call for too much flour?,"I love chocolate chip cookies not just for their taste, but how easy it is to experiment with them. So I like to try different recipes to produce cookies with different textures, and one thing I have found to be universal is that I always have to dial back the amount of flour called for to achieve the desired texture, otherwise the cookies always come out the same: dry and cakey.

What gives? I always use the spoon and level technique, instead of scooping right into the flour, to avoid packing. Why does literally every cookie recipe I've tried end up too dry and cakey until I do it over again and dial back the flour? Is it because the butter I'm using doesn't have a high enough fat content?

1426,80% hydration Sourdough Loaf,"Hello! Anyone willing to help out a new-ish sourdough enthusiast? I’ve had my starter for almost two months and have been baking enthusiastically with it. I’ve enjoyed some good loaves and some not so good. To be expected. So, I’ve been trying to up my hydration! Just for giggles. I do enjoy the lower hydration loaves, the feel of the dough and taste and texture of the bakes, but I’d also like to challenge myself a bit with going higher. 

The loaves o made in the past that have been wetter I’ve obviously had trouble with spreading. I have done a lot of bakes from the perfect loaf website, so that’s where I’ve been getting a lot of my information. Up until today I would do the mixing, bulk ferment, and shape, then proof in the fridge overnight. I recently moved to south Texas and it has been hot and humid, so I felt like as I was trying to get the dough to rise in a warm spot (my garage) the dough would be too warm and I’d put it in the fridge and the next morning it would be over proofed from residual heat and I’d get the squatty loaves in the oven. Super bummer. My garage turns out.. is probably 85 degrees. I rose a loaf in my house today (around 75 degrees) and did bulk ferment and proof and bake all in one day. No fridge rest. After a 2 hour proof I did the poke test and I felt it maybe already overproofed! Again! Preheated oven, dumped out bread, watched it spread all over the parchment, scored the loaf haphazardly, it was so soft, and chucked it in the Dutch oven. 

All that to say, it came out... ok. I haven’t cut it yet, too hot, BUT I want my loaves to be tall and beautiful and round! Not squatty. What are some tips for a higher hydration? Is even my house (air conditioned at 75) too warm for my starter/proofs? The dough felt really good when I was shaping and I felt like I had made a pretty good taught outer skin, but it just smooshed when I dumped it out of its proving bowl lined with towel. 

Will attach pic of outside of loaf! Hope the posts not too long 🙈

Oh, and formula: 400g KA bread flour, 100g generic whole wheat, 400g filtered water, 10g salt, 110g starter at 100% hydration.

1428,Cookie recipe help?,"Hey all, I have a choc chip cookie recipe that's been in the family for ages but I've always kinda wondered if it could be improved upon and stuff. Recipe is as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

- 2 eggs

- 1/2 cup softened margarine or butter

- 2 tsp baking soda

- 2 tsp vanilla extract

- 1 cup brown sugar

- 1/2 cup white sugar

- 1 cup choc chips of choice

- 2 cups ap flour

&amp;nbsp;

Now I could be missing something for ingredients here as I'm rattling them off by memory so if I forgot something obvious forgive me. I know I should probably use butter instead of margarine but oh well. I guess I'm mostly concerned with the amount of flour? Usually it's fine but I made cookies the other day and they werent.... that good. I followed the recipe but after watching What's Eating Dan on youtube and his vid about cookies I melted the margarine, used 1 egg white with 2 yolks (like he suggests) and it was super super super super dry. So I added in that other white as I hadn't tossed it yet and it moistened back up some. The other issue I think was that I guess we had dark brown sugar instead of light? I honestly don't know how much difference it makes on using one or the other but I can tell you instead of having like a usual crisp cookie it was kind of dense? It reminded me of a molasses cookie with it's consistency and I don't know what part of everything caused it. So yeah I guess this is kinda a ""how did I fuck it up"" and also ""what could I do to change it aside from using butter instead of margarine"". If it helps I love my cookies chewey n gooey.

1429,To Gluten or not to Gluten?,"Im a baker at a small cafe and the owners would like me to make a ""gluten-free"" pastry, but I refuse to advertise anything as ""gluten-free"" because of inevitable cross contamination.

I love macarons, they're one of my favorite delicasies. I've made them 4 times now and out of those times, 2 times have been failures. One of the succeeded ones was a box mix.

The most recent one was a foolproof chocolate macaron recipe which offered a really nice helping guide and super precise instructions i think i did follow well, but I ended up with one sheet of hollow shells and second sheet of spread ones. 

I knew beforehand that there is going to be about a million ways to make a mistake which will kill the whole batch, but i find it an issue that there seems to be infinite amounts of variables that will lead to an unsuccesful cookie.

Fe. the instructions say to beat the egg whites for 6 minutes. How do I know my beaters will be fast/slow enough? What kind of stiff/soft/semihard peaks are the right kind of peaks? What kind of pressure should i have when stirring the baked though? Instructions said to fold 74 times, but what if that isn't enough? How will I know my oven's 160 celsius is the same as the recipe's 160 celsius? 

I feel like while wondering these things the macarons are sensing my fear and from there go ruined just to fuck with me. 

I'm  pretty sure everyone here has had at least some problems like this. So my question is that is there some way to sort out the different variables that may lead to unsuccessful cookies? (can be applied to any kind of baking i guess) 

also, has anyone had any experience making macarons in bigger batches in advance to parties etc. and how did that work out? I was planning to make these to a graduation party to around 60 people and i really hope i wouldn't have to abandon this idea if there is something that could to wrong

Chai-Spiced Banana Upside-Down Cake

 
Author: Sasha Gill

Recipe type: Vegan

Serves: 8-10

Ingredients

Banana Layer

¼ cup vegan butter

¾ cup light brown sugar

¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

3 tablespoons dark rum

3 large ripe bananas, peeled

Cake

⅔ cup soy milk

2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar

⅓ cup vegan butter

¾ cup white sugar

⅓ cup mashed banana (about 1 banana)

¼ cup double-strength chai tea*

3 tbsp aquafaba

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking soda

1 teaspoon baking powder

¼ teaspoon salt

1 tsp cinnamon

1 tsp ginger

¼ tsp nutmeg

Optional - A pinch of cloves, allspice, or cardamom powder

Instructions

Preheat the oven to 180C and grease an 8-inch round cake tin, and line the bottom. I used a springform tin to make it easier to unfold but a regular pan should work too.

Place the butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring frequently to dissolve the sugar. Add the rum and simmer gently on medium heat for 4 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes then tip into the base of the tin. I like to reserve a few tablespoons of this caramel to brush over the cake when it is done, but this is optional and if you prefer to keep it simple, just tip all of the syrup into the tin.

Slice the bananas lengthways and place cut side down in the tin, trimming them to fit and cover the base. Set aside.

In a small bowl, mix the soy milk and vinegar together. Leave this for five minutes to allow the milk to thicken. Meanwhile, cream the vegan butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Next, stir in the thickened soy milk mixture, mashed banana, chai tea, aquafaba and vanilla. Mix this well. Now, sift in the flour, baking soda, powder, salt, and spices together. Fold until just combined, taking care not to overmix. The batter should be fairly thick but still pourable.

Gently pour the batter over the bananas, taking care not to dislodge them and even the top out with a spatula.

Bake for 45-50 minutes until puffed and golden and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 5-10 minutes then run a knife around the inside of the tin. Invert the cake onto a serving plate or board. Serve warm",t3_bm16p4,Jedi_Knight_TomServo,0

   * 5 egg whites (room temperature)
   * 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
* Fold egg whites into the batter and pour into 16 cup tube pan (lined, but not greased).
   * I just put parchment paper on the bottom of the tube pan
* Bake at 325 for 55 minutes, turn half way through.
* cool upside down completely, cut sides with a knife to remove.

\-

**Attempt 1...**  When I poured the batter into the pan I noticed that I hadn't done enough folding of the egg whites in.  parts were too fluffy and parts were were too runny.   I tried to give an extra stir in the pan, but I think this was an obvious problem of the first attempt.  The cake rose very high in the oven but started to shrink not long after i turned it.  My guess is the high point was about 3x the volume of the original batter.  By the time I took the cake out it was about 2x the volume of the original batter (didn't seem like a complete deal breaker?  I'm not sure....  I'm quite new to baking).

What happened next was consistent between the two bakes.   About 2 minutes after turning upside down most of the cake fell out.  Some remained stuck to the sides, but the cake wasn't strong enough to hold itself together and anything not touching a side fell out.  Once this happened it quickly deflated from the original 3"" height to 1"" of gummy mess.

\-

**Attempt 2...** everything here is the same except I fully mixed the whites and the batter.  The rise in the oven wasn't quite as dramatic, but looked good.  The following shrink did seem worse however as the cake started to fold in on itself.  After removing from the oven and turning over I had the same issue with the bulk of the cake plopping out.

\-

My gut tells me that I'm still messing up two things.

1. **The cake is falling out while cooling** \-  I assume the cake is too heavy for its structure.  I'm tempted to cut the water from 3/4 a cup to 1/2 a cup and see if this happens again.  The batter itself has been pretty runny so far.
2. **The rise and fall of the cake in the oven** \- This feels like a temperature problem.  My oven usually runs pretty close to the temperature I set it at, but I didn't have my thermometer in last night to double check.  The fall always happened at some point after the turn.  My guess is the temperature is ok, but that the fluctuation is too dramatic when i turn the cake?  I might wait longer to turn it or even not turn it at all?  I'm very much open to suggestions here because I'm not quite sure what's going on.

320g cake flour, sifted. (approx scant 3 cups prior to sifting)

1 tbsp baking powder

This is a recipe I thought I had perfect for a soft, fluffy and spongy vanilla cake. I have made it before without this problem. Yes the batter lands up being on the runny side, more akin to an oil based chocolate cake batter.

I have a feeling the oven may have been running a bit hot. I don't have an oven thermometer.

Otherwise the cake turned out perfectly, and I suppose if I were doing this professionally I would probably cut the top part off anyway, but I was curious if anyone has seen this happen before, because I never had.

1472,Big cookies without being too gooey?,"I love big 5 - 6 oz chocolate chip cookies and am going crazy with recipe experiments. My goal is to create a large cookie I can serve warm with melty chocolate without the center coming across overly wet &amp; gooey. I'm here for a second pair of eyes because I'm going in circles.

Note- They need to be baked cold rather than immediately after dough is made.

[This recipe](https://www.modernhoney.com/levain-bakery-chocolate-chip-crush-cookies/), with 3 cups/18 oz chocolate chips and omitting nuts, was my starting point. I've found with 410 high temp/shorter bake, the cookies are way too gooey until completely cool and set. Lower temps + longer bake + letting them spread more didn't work. When warm, the inside is still too wet/gooey when the outside is perfectly golden. Correct me if I'm wrong but, from what I gather, this ingredient ratio will not work for my goal.

In comparison, [this recipe](https://www.brittneylongcurations.com/copycat-crumbl-cookies-recipe/) has the same egg but more butter, sugar &amp; flour. However, the cookies have a grainy exterior from undissolved sugar [seen here.](https://imgur.com/mNoRopr) Delicious but not perfect.

[This recipe](https://houseofyumm.com/thick-chocolate-chip-cookies/) keeps butter &amp; eggs the same as recipe #1 while adding a lot more flour + sugar. I did switch the leavening a little for color but the inside after 10 mins cooling looks [like this.](https://imgur.com/a/sEeIvOU) It was firm and edible fresh from the oven but the flavor was meh. Not in love.

While not necessarily dry, both of these become pretty hard at room temp. Bummer! Is it even possible to get cookies this big to be soft at room temp while not overly gooey warm?

Hello, I was hoping I could get some advice! Sugar cookies are normally my game — this will be the first cake I’ve attempted. I want to try [this recipe](https://iscreamforbuttercream.com/favorite-vanilla-bean-cake/), but am wanting to make three 8” round pans instead of two. 

Using a recipe scaler tool, it gave me the following measurements:

* 4 1/2 cups cake flour
* 3 cups sugar
* 2 1/4 tsp baking powder
* 3/4 tsp baking soda
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 cup butter
* 1 1/2 cup sour cream
* 3/4 cup whole milk
* 1 1/2 tbsp oil
* 1 1/2 tbsp vanilla bean paste
* 3/4 tsp almond emulsion
* 4.5 eggs

* Does the above scaling seem accurate to you? Should I go with 4 or 5 eggs?
* Is this too risky for a noob who hasn’t used this recipe before to attempt? Or should it be fine since everything is supposedly in proportion?

I'm not overmixing the batter, so I'm suspecting the issue is in how the batter is cooked. I'm using a non-stick pan sprayed with cooking spray over a low to medium heat on a gas stove. The pan is in good condition (none of the coating is flaking off), and I'm watching the edges carefully and flipping it once the bubbles really get going.

My problem is that I can't find the happy medium for well-cooked pancakes. Either I completely burn the outside to properly cook the inside, or the outside looks black and the inside is gooey. It doesn't seem like there's an in-between.

What should I do to fix this? Should I switch to a stainless steel pan? I've heard those work better than non-stick. Should I use butter or vegetable oil on the pan as opposed to cooking spray? And could I be provided with a more vanilla, buttery pancake recipe?",t3_bfecng,[deleted],0

My family used to get this bread at a polish bakery all the time but it has fallen out of fashion I think and the chocolate and cinnamon type dense babkas have become more popular. The last few years it has been basically impossible to get. The only stores I can find it are at like supermarkets around easter time and of course they are loaded with preservatives and junk. So I thought, maybe I could learn to make it and release my family from this frustration!!! 

However, I'm having an issue with the bread and despite my research I can't figure out what is wrong. I am following a recipe here https://hostessatheart.com/cheese-babka-twelveloaves/ but I have baked it twice and found the texture is not what I'm used to. If I didn't stuff it with sweet cheese, it would taste to me like a regular old white bread. It's good. But it's not the babka type texture, which is meant to be light and soft. I have tried kneading the dough more this time around. It think its a bit softer but still not what I was looking for. It rises great both times and bakes well. I have also seen some other recipes that use more flour and egg yolks instead of whole eggs. I tried to search for things like, what makes bread soft but all the websites that came up seem to say its about not rising enough or not kneading enough. Is it possible I'm still not kneading enough??? How long do you knead for? I think I did for like 3-5 minutes. The rise seemed fine so I dont think its my yeast. This is the other recipie I found https://www.beneaththecrust.com/blog/2018/3/27/sweet-cheese-babka This one has the crumb topping, which is also usually a hallmark of cheese babka.

When I came back every single piece was moldy! They have green spots and taste awful... What could it be? A spoiled ingredient? Left them out for too long?

How can I avoid this in the future? :(

UPDATE: More people are saying that was just color from the fruits and unfortunately I threw the cake away before investigating further, so I can't say for sure what happened: if the piece I tasted just happened to taste bad (or some sort of placebo effect) or it was actually moldy.

1519,Deflating Donuts,"I've been working at a donut shop in Canada for the past 5 months and we've been having a problem with our donuts ""deflating"" after proofing. 

We have tried almost everything. 
Changing cutters, dough thickness, mixing time, proofing time, table time, the amount of yeast, the amount of scraps re-mixed into the dough, the order in which we put the bags of dough in the fridge. (we do an overnight cold proof and then the second proof in an actual proofer)


The main things that have changed that might contribute to the problem are:

1. We changed cutters, but we switched back to the original with no difference in product.

2. We bought a new proofer (I think it's related to this)

4. We are creating much larger quantities of dough than prior to 5 months ago, this means there's less space in our fridge for air flow.

3. I was hired (I would like to imagine that I am not the problem)


Our proofer is set to 26C and 80% humidity and we proof for round 30 minutes. 

The overnight proof lasts around 15 hours and it's in a 4C fridge, we are buying a new walk in fridge because the one we have now is so small that there is basically no air circulation (the current fridge is not a walk in.) (This may also contribute to the problem)

We proof the cut donuts in large batches around 240 donuts each spread over 10 racks in the proofer, for some reason our second batch always comes out a little better.

Our oil Temperature is 375F and we're using canola oil.

I unfortunately cannot share the recipe because I have a signed agreement to not share it, but I can give the yeast % or sugar % if needed. 


Sorry for the huge post, I would really appreciate the help because it's getting more and more stressful to watch the owners worry about how many donuts they're going to have to pitch everyday. ",t3_b97csd,thelentha,0

19 ounces of Bread Flour (Weighed)

1 1/2 Cups water (Between 100 and 110 degrees F)

1 1/2 tsp Salt

1 Packet of yeast

Long story short, I mix the yeast, water and a little flour, make sure it's active, add everything, knead in mixer with dough hook for a few minutes. Spritz bowl with canola oil, set dough in, and place in turned off stove with towel over it to rise (90-120 mins until doubled). From there, I knead it down, cut into pieces, roll into balls, let rest 10 mins, then roll it into sandwich roll shape, cover and let rise again (60-90 mins). This is where my problem is! It doubles in size again (or close to it), but it doesn't hold itself up, so instead of getting a round loaf, it's flat on the bottom and looks like a deformed ciabatta, denser than it should be. I can't raise it longer, as it would flatten more, and I can't raise it shorter, as it would be way too small. Could working the dough for longer or shorter periods at certain stages affect it?

1544,Where can I find a guide to savory Arab &amp; Middle Eastern baked goods?,"**TL;DR:** Where can I find a guide to the traditional savory baked goods and breads of the Middle East and North Africa?

-----

I live in Detroit, Michigan (USA). We have long been a destination for peoples immigrating to the US from the Middle East and North Africa, particularly Arabs. As a result, we have a wealth of outstanding food from every corner of that region.

The entrees and salads and soups and sides found in restaurants are widespread and well-known by nearly everyone here, transcending race and socioeconomics, but for some reason the bakeries have never found the same broad assimilation in our metro's food culture. As a result, I could practically give a Ted Talk on the history and modern role of things like hummus and kibbe and sujuk and falafel; or about the differences between food from the Levant, the Arabian peninsula, or Northwest Africa; or about the rules of halal preparation and how those purposes are reflected in other facets of hospitality and food culture in those countries...

...but when I walk in the front door of an Arab bakery, I don't have the first damn clue what I'm looking at. If it's not a flatbread (pita/khubz, lavash, injera), I probably don't know what it is. Typically the staff are seniors who speak little or no English, and if there's anything written down, it's in Arabic (which I can't read or speak). Everything in the cases or the back shelves looks delicious, but I hate having to communicate by pointing, and I hate having to roll the dice by picking things at random since I have no idea what's on them or in them.

It's fairly easy to find guides to the sweet pastries of the region and culture, but I'd really like to learn more about the savory bread-based items. There are all sorts of pizzas and hand pies and breads with fillings and breads with toppings, and I don't know what any of it is. I'd like to be able to order a little less awkwardly, but I'd also like to be able to research each item (food history is a hobby of mine) and possibly bake it at home, and I can't do any of that if I don't even know the names.

It's not a big issue but it's annoying. I have Mrs. Fields cookie recipe and towards the end of the batch, there's a bunch of cookie goodies that aren't really binding together.

TLDR of the recipe:1:1:1 of butter, sugar, and brown sugar with a bunch of oatmeal and flower with other goodies added in

Recipe:

2 C. butter

2 C. white sugar

2 C. brown sugar

4 Eggs

2 Tbs Vanilla (or a bit more)

4 C. flour

5 C. oatmeal

1 tsp salt

2 tsp baking powder

2 tsp baking soda

24 oz choc. chips

3 cups chopped nuts (I do walnuts or pecans, depending on whats on sale.

Cream the butter and sugars together, add vanilla and eggs. Mix well add in dry ingredients. Bake at usual time and temp. Normally I let the dough chill an hour or more before I start to bake them for flavor and moisture to do its thing.

[Picture of dough](https://imgur.com/a/y72OvnK). 

I've figured it's a hydration issue of some sort. Either not through mixing (recipe as is makes enough to fill most of 32 C. Tupperware bowl or 7.8 Liter bowl for my metric friends) or there's not enough liquid/fat for the recipe as it stands.

1575,Opinions on oil-based cupcake recipes?,"I love making cupcakes and generally speaking they turn out amazingly! However, there is one type of cupcake I have not been able to master: oil-based cupcakes. So far I've attempted around 5 recipes and each one has had it's own share of issues. I keep telling myself I'll never make an oil-based cupcake again, but I'm a glutton for punishment. 

Issues have ranged from: 

- [Cupcakes tasted terrible](https://sugarandcloth.com/lemon-orange-olive-oil-cupcakes/)
- Cupcakes were ridiculously oily/greasy
- [Cupcakes stuck to wrappers -- both paper and silicon -- so dramatically that they could not be removed to eat](https://www.thebakingfairy.net/2015/07/chocolate-coca-cola-cupcakes/)

From what I can tell, the benefit of using oil (vs butter) would be the temperature changes in the oil, which result in a slightly crispy cupcake top with moist insides. However, I've *never* had an oil-based recipe turn out this way. 

I'm curious if these issues are just the nature of oil-based cupcakes? Are these recipes just *that* finicky? 

More importantly... Is there anyone that swears by oil-based cupcake recipes? If I finally *do* throw in the towel for good, will I be missing out? ",t3_ay0liq,8-BitBaker,0

How many times would recommend sifting the flour? I've seen as few as three times and as much as six! 

Some recipes seem to indicate you should whip the egg whites to soft peaks and then integrate the cream of tartar and sugar, while others say go full firm peaks and then integrate everything. Is one way more successful in your opinion?

In general, do you have any recommendations for making a successful angel food cake? Bonus points if you tell me your favorite way to dress it up. I was thinking a lemon pudding/whipping cream icing but would love to hear opinions of those more well-versed in cake making than myself!

So yesterday I followed this recipe to make chocolate chip cookies:

The ending up not ""melting"" as they baked, they just stayed in the form I globed them on to the tray. They didn't end up having that flat cookie look with golden edges. The texture was pretty consistent throughout the whole cookie, they didn't have crispy edges and chewy centers.

1592,"Ratios make no sense, how to learn properly","I have been learning how to bake from scratch. I am interested in WHY they combine things in certain ways and WHY that combination is this kind of product and not another. I have read ""Cooking for geeks"", ""Flavor Bible"", and ""Ratio"". They all describe their specific concepts neatly but none of them actually convey a complete concept that you can actually apply.

Eg 1. A recipe that makes soupy muffins, burnt tops, and uncooked grey centers as the ""ratio"" is off, even though the author talks about adhering to ratios.

    1 cup - Chopped Strawberries
    1.5 cups - Flour
    1.5 tsp - Baking powder
    1 tsp - Salt
    0.5 tsp - Baking soda
    1 cup - Sugar
    2 - Eggs
    0.5 cups - Mashed banana
    0.25 cups - Veg oil
    1 tsp - Vanilla extract
    1 cup - Blueberries

Now I knew as soon as this was mixed it was WAY to runny and all that fruit would juice quite a bit. But as I am learning and the library book is from an author who talks about ratios I would just follow the recipe. Well I cooked them as prescribed in a greased muffin tin and the centers were soggy and they collapsed.

Now here is a recipe from a baking book from the 1960's I inherited. They work perfectly every time. I weighed the ingredients to see if even this ""followed the ratios""

Eg 2. Good muffins

    (50g) 1 - Egg
    (187g) 0.75 cups - Milk
    (53g) 0.25 cups - Veg oil
    (260g) 2 cups - Flour
    (2g) 0.5 tsb - Salt
    (6g) 2 tsb - Baking powder
    (110g) 0.5 cup - Sugar

So if this is the golden muffin Ratio:

    3 - Flour, 1 - Fat, 2 - Liquid, 1 - Egg

The first recipie is so complex I don't even know how to figure out its ratios. But for the 1960's one:

    5.2 - Flour, 1 - Fat, 3.74 - Liquid, 1 - Egg
    Is ""Flour"" all the dry ingredients?
    If so then it's 7.56 - Flour

So what good is the actual concept of ratio if nothing follows it and I have no examples?

The whole point of this is 2 fold. EVERYTHING now days uses a butt load of sugar. 1+ cups of sugar in a dozen muffins is sickening, I need to know how to reduce it. And the main point of learning the WHY is, say I have 2 bananas, almonds and 1.5 cups of buttermilk to use up. HOW do I actually combine those ingredients into a reliable product without a recipe???

1594,How long does cookie dough last?,"I've been using [this](https://www.mybakingaddiction.com/new-york-times-chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe/) chocolate chip cookie recipe to make some extra large cookies.  I've started to make a lot of dough with it and I've noticed that my storage of batter in steadily increasing.  As of now, my personal protocol is such that dough that is made today and baked tomorrow is stored in the fridge overnight while as dough that would be baked later on in the week is stored in the freezer.

&amp;#x200B;

Googling on it led me to some sites regarding the topic ([1](http://www.eatbydate.com/other/baking/cookie-dough/), [2](https://stilltasty.com/fooditems/index/18754), [3](https://www.bobsredmill.com/blog/healthy-living/how-long-is-cookie-dough-good-for/)).  Apparently, storing it in the fridge has it lasting a couple of weeks but storing it in the freezer gives it as much as 8 months to live.  

&amp;#x200B;

As such, there are some particular questions I'd like to ask:

* Does cookie dough really last 3-8 months in the freezer?  Or does it perish much shorter than that? 
* Are there other factors that affect the shelf life of the dough?   ",t3_au3lt5,NanditoNaSiKiko,0

I have been baking for the mechanics at work lately. I've made mini pumpkin pie tarts and Swiss rolls (strawberry/buttercream and cinnamon/lemon curd). Yesterday, they asked me if I could make them truffles the next time I swing by the shop.

It seems a fairly simple recipe to follow but I don't really want to make just a regular chocolate truffle. I was thinking of adding fruit flavors or coffee or some sort of spice but at what point should I add it?? Do I go with artificial flavor or zest or finely chopped/mashed?? 

I'm at a loss of when to add the flavor to the chocolate mix. Half of me thinks to add the zest or flavoring to the cream as it's heating up, the other half thinks to mix it in the same time as the chocolate. 

Also, I saw some recipes call for liqueur. Can you taste the alcohol or catch a buzz from too many truffles?? If so, I'll have to exclude it as I will be taking these into work with a very strict zero tolerance for drinking at work.

1614,Fruit Confit: Glazing,"Hi! I am just finishing up a batch of candied/glace/confit orange slices. I've been following the old school French method of slowly raising the baume/brix little by little, once a day, for almost two weeks now. They look and taste wonderful and are definitely ready to be ""finished"". Unfortunately, resources that I have for finishing are all a bit... unclear. The easiest way is just to package them in their own syrup, but I would like something a bit less gooey/bulky. I know they can simply be washed and dried or rubbed in sanding sugar, but what I am particularly interested in is ""glazing"" or icing them. 

The recipe I'm using, which also reflects footage I've seen, offers a slightly translucent, shiny coating. In this recipe, you are to bring a 1000 g sugar and 300 g water to 239° at which point you ""carefully"" rub the spatula on the side of the pot thereby crystallizing a ""a small portion"" which you are then supposed to ""delicately"" mix in so that the candies take on a slightly crystallized glaze. Obviously, once the sugar begins to crystallize there is very little time left before the syrup is completely seized. In my experience, what time there is typically leaves a glaze that is large in crystal structure and not at all shiny. 

I've experimented with taking the sugar to 310° which leaves a wonderful, thin slightly crunchy, shiny like glass glaze on the candies. I actually love this glaze and don't mind if this is what I end up stuck with, but the perfectionist in me wants to know what the hell this guy is talking about. 

Information on this entire process is slim to say the least and a lot of what I can find seems to be in French. I was hoping someone out there might be able to offer some guidance! 

To sweeten the deal, I am about to start a batch of whole tangerines (lil cuties) and would be happy to send a finished one your way should your wisdom lead to the perfection of the glaze.

***NUT BREAD***

(Kolacz)

· 1 yeast cake

· ¼ Cup of water

· 1 tsp. Salt

· 6 or more cups of flour (sifted)

· 2 large eggs

· 2 Cups Carnation evaporated milk

· ¾ Cup Sugar

In a large mixing bowl dissolve yeast cake in lukewarm water. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy

Add milk to dissolved yeast and stir. Add 3 cups of flour and beat well. Mix in creamed butter and sugar,

Add eggs and blend. Gradually add the remainder of the salt and flour a ½ cup at a time, until the dough is smooth enough to handle. Knead the remaining flour into the dough, in the bowl.

The dough should be smooth and elastic to the touch, and never hard or stiff, in fact, for fluffy bread, the dough should be a little on the soft side yet beaten or kneaded well to avoid stickiness.

Place the dough on a floured cloth and cover. Allow to rise until double in size. About an hour.

\*\*Nut filling recipe and instructions on preparing Nut Bread on following page\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

that's the recipe word for word.

Do I skip dissolving the yeast and just add dry yeast when I'm mixing everything else?

All and all, everything went well, but I noticed that the final result was very crumbly and as a result, I couldn't cut the biscotti as thin as I would have liked so it didn't get particularly crunchy. 

The taste was amazing though and they weren't hard to make, so I think I'd like to try again!

Do the above changes sound like they'd yield a better biscotti or does anyone have a recipe suggestion for a biscotti I could add dates and a bit of orange extra to? :)

1643,Small Updates and Seeking Mods!,"Happy New Year, everyone!

In just under 30 days our numbers have skyrocketed from 1082 members to 9925. This is largely thanks to u/imightbemary for mentioning us during an r/AskReddit thread. Moderating for you nearly 10,000 bakers has been amazing. I really cannot say enough about how great you all are. Before my eyes start to sweat, let's just jump right in!  

-------------

##Rules Updates

We've added two new rules: **Use the Search Feature**, and **We Are Not Google**. Essentially these rules are to encourage people to look for the answer to their question before posting it as I've seen several of the same questions posted numerous times over the last few days, and the second is to prevent people from trying to turn this into their own personal Pintrest Board of recipes.  

If you ever notice a rule violation, please remember to report it. It's the community that makes this place amazing, and I'd like your help keeping it that way.

-----------

##Mod Applications

That being said, I definitely can't do this on my own. While I've been able to keep up for the most part, there are just so many posts incoming I can hardly keep up to review them all! I'm finally ready to ask for help. The first thing you have to know is this is kind of a cake-walk (pun intended). We don't get a ton of reports/spam, but sometimes people do trigger the AutoMod. I'm looking for 3-5 awesome, inspired, passionate bakers to help me out with this. You can find our [application here](https://goo.gl/forms/44B079qNsR2OADX22) and I'll be adding a sidebar button as well. Mod applications will be rolling, and as the need arises we'll pull from the list to ask for help.

----------------

Again, I really appreciate the community we've built here. I love how helpful and amazing you all are, and I really can't say enough how this is (most definitely, probably) the best sub on all of Reddit. Keep being amazing everyone, and I thank you from my (no longer soggy) bottom.",t3_amv328,RecurvBow,0

This [cookie](https://imgur.com/a/rgN1cbm) has a distinct crackled top that acts like a crispy layer of goodness while the interior is still chewy. I've been looking at information online to find that ways to obtain a crackled outer layer like the one pictured, and I've found a couple of (possible?) ways to get it. 


* reduce the overall moisture in the recipe (ie. less eggs, possibly browning butter?)
* over leaven the cookie.
* take cookies out of oven while they are raw, allowing them to collapse on themselves, resulting cracks.


For reference, the cookie in question is from Cafe Madeleine in Boston. I think that I might have seen them putting their, possibly cold, cookies on baking sheets in the rough shape of a puck. Could the shaping and the fact that the cookie might be put into the oven cold play a role?

Any insight would be appreciated!

I'm planning to make my boyfriend cheesecake for his birthday on Wednesday. The only thing is I want it to be a surprise but since we live together, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do that. I have some ideas but would like the opinion of expert bakers (so glad this subreddit exists haha) before deciding which one to go with.

 I was thinking of prepping the filling today and then storing it in another fridge until Wednesday to bake it. I'm just wondering if doing that will ruin or alter the filling? (Leaving it the fridge for two days) 

Or, my second option is to make the cheesecake today and leave it in the fridge until Wednesday. Would that affect the ""freshness"" of the cake? I also might be on a time crunch as he gets off earlier today than on Wednesday. But I know some recipes call to chill the cake for x hours before serving and doing this option would give me plenty of time to cool whereas Wednesday might be tight. 

What do you think?

My issue is that no matter how much I do the macaronage, I can't bring down the consistency. It seems like it's 6 or so folds away from perfect. You'll notice with the recipe that youre supposed to add granulated sugar to the foamy egg whites , but doesn't specify the amount. 

 The batter also looks slightly grainy as I pipe it out. I leave the shells out for a half hour before I bake and it's fine , but I'm not getting that nice smoothness. I suspect that there is too much cocoa powder as well.

1) The texture is halfway between a brownie and a cake, is there leavening agent I can add that would make it rise just a bit without affecting the taste too much? 

2) I'm hoping to make individual cakes, either in mini-cupcake size or in a silicone mold that's like a mini-loaf (holds about 2 TBSP batter each). I baked the first try in the mini-loaf, but the loafs stuck terribly. I tried the waiting ~5 minutes but that was the worst. Completely crumbled apart.

There's usually whipped cream in the center (under the marron cream), but I'm looking for an alternative, as my boyfriend just isn't too fond of dairy whipped cream.

What would be the best possible substitute? It would need to be light and fluffy but able to hold its shape, like regular whipped cream, and not overpower or clash with the flavour of the marron.

I've done a bit of research and am thinking italian meringue buttercream (with minimal butter) might be good, but I'm not sure as I've never made it before.  
Coconut whipped cream might be another option, but I'm afraid it's too soft and won't hold its own.

1688,Using Rosewater or Rose Extracts in Custard,"Hi all, I’m a novice baker, experienced and curious but ultimately a hobbyist just doing it for the fun of things. One of my favorite things to make is a cheesecake. I’ve been sitting in this idea for a rose cheesecake with raspberries, or possibly rose and vanilla with a raspberry rose sauce and I’m inquiring if anyone has either a good tip on how to use incorporate rose flavors into a cheesecake or a recipe for one?

It seems like rose flavoring is typically a rose water and sometimes a rose extract. I’m wondering if that’s the best way to go for something like a rose cheesecake or custard, as such desserts are sensitive to water content and seem to do better with alcohol based extracts or oils. Could I use rosewater in a custard? Anyone know how well the flavor stands up to heat? Like could I also use it in a traditional flour cake?

1696,"Bread &amp; Pastries, Steam, and a Baking Steel?","I have frequently bake bread and other pastries at home, and have a few miscellaneous questions concerning bread baking and steam, as well as using a baking steel. Thanks for any advice that can be provided!

* When following a recipe that recommends using a spray bottle to mist the oven (to create steam) during baking, should I be misting the oven or specifically misting straight at/on the loaf?
* I have typically noticed the crusts come out better/crispier when baked in a dutch oven or cloche, due to the inherent steam buildup - better than what I could provide by misting. Is this dutch oven method a better method than putting water on the bottom of the oven as well?
* I have a baking steel for making pizzas. It works great for that purpose. I’m interested in trying it for other things, such as bread or pastries (puff pastry, tart crusts, laminated dough, choux, etc). Does a baking steel improve things (crust, rise, etc.) with bread or pastries - or is it not worth the bother? If a baking steel improves over the traditional oven method, should the bread/pastry be placed directly on the baking steel on parchment, or should it be on baking sheet placed onto the baking steel? How does baking on a baking steel affect bake times and temperatures?
* Or is it better to use the baking steel only for heat purposes, and therefore place it lower in the oven and bake on a rack over it? Does this method actually improve anything with bread or pastry?
* Finally, if using a baking steel and baking bread, should I be worried about using steam in the oven around or on the steel? I wouldn’t want it to rust, but perhaps that wouldn’t be a problem in a hot oven.",t3_aghil2,Jaw3000,0

2. If I make and bake them today or tomorrow and then freeze them (and then take them out to thaw Saturday afternoon), will they thaw alright in the store-bought crumb crusts?

The standard 1 stick butter, 1 egg etc..comes out perfectly thick and round. When I double that amount the cookies often spread and look like puddles! I keep having to push the edges back in while it's still hot to make them presentable. The starting butter temp is the same, process is the same, dough is chilled the same. I thought the issue might be adding both eggs at once but I tried fully incorporating one at a time and it didn't help. My only other ideas are potential over-creaming or under-mixing.

I watch the butter/sugar and stop when it looks lighter and fluffy, typically 3-4 mins on kitchenaid level 4 starting from cold cubed butter. It doesn't take as long when making a single batch but the texture looks the same to me. I add the eggs and mix on level 2. The texture is mousse-like once the eggs are incorporated. Then I add dry ingredients by pulsing first before continuing on low until almost incorporated, add mix-ins and turn on high very briefly to distribute them. Is it possible I'm not letting the flour mix in long enough? Cookie recipes always mention being careful not to over-mix so I try to keep it minimal. This doesn't cause any issues with the original quantity. Could it be something with the aeration process instead? Does it have to do with how long the eggs are mixed into the butter/sugar?

1740,Avoid buns getting moist when storing,"Hi,

Lately, I've been making [these japanese milk buns](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/japanese-milk-bread-rolls-recipe) for burgers. I don't eat them all the first day, so I store them in a zip plastic bag. When I take them out the next day, the outside part is moist, sticky. I put them like 15 seconds in the oven and they're not sticky anymore.

I don't know anything about baking honestly. What causes that ? Is is the moisture that can't get out of the plastic bag ? Where should I store them instead to keep the quality for 1 to 2 days ?",t3_a3frwa,Karkuro,0

However, it was fairly crumbly and almost short in texture-- I'm wondering how to get a more open crumb structure.

 I know the general rule is wetter mix+good quality yeast+sufficient gluten = open crumb and larger bubbles, but how would you modify this recipe to get there? Is that even possible in a sandwich style bread like this? I have made the NYT no knead 24 loaf and things like it before so I know I can achieve it that way, but I'd also like to play around with the sandwich bread style.

2. What are some things I can do with my now stale rolls?

This is how I stored them for the drive...I’m now seeing that this was definitely not the right way and feel pretty silly. I know they aren't the prettiest, but they did taste good fresh! Thank you!!

In a homemade ""biscuit"" recipe in Portuguese, I see it has gelatine, icing sugar/confectioner's sugar, CMC gum, glucose, vegetable fat, egg whites, and corn flour, amongst other things.

1759,Stand Mixer: Tilt-Head vs Bowl-Lift,"I recently got a Kitchenaid bowl-lift stand mixer and I was immensely frustrated with it. The instructions say that it should be able to handle whipping only 2 eggs whites, but that wasn't the case. I took the bowl out and hand whipped the egg whites to get some volume, in the hope that after that I'd be able to use the stand mixer for the rest of the recipe. This wasn't the case. Furthermore, the bowl was high and narrow; I couldn't even get my cream of tartar directly into the bowl without it all sticking to the sides or ending up in the top portion of the whisk. Although this isn't the end of the world with cream of tartar, it would be a much bigger issue with other ingredients. Stopping the machine, lowering the bowl, and adding ingredients is an option, but also a pain. It was also a fight to get the bowl into position.

I'm not looking to make any super heavy doughs. Mainly cakes, cookies, buttercream, etc. Are tilt-head mixers a much better option for this kind of baking?",t3_9whetv,endgoal_edible,0

1763,Is there a reason why a recipe for a sandwich bread wouldn't work for an artisan loaf shape?,"So I used to work as a baker and I just got back into bread making at home making own starter and whatnot. but I've been using this recipe: 

1 cup ripe (fed) sourdough starter
1 cup + 2 tablespoons lukewarm water
3 cups King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour or Premium 100% Whole Wheat Flour
2 tablespoons whole grain bread improver, optional; for a better, faster rise
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon instant yeast
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Which calls for being made into a bread loaf, but I've been trying to shape it into a football or round and it's come by out all flat.
