And making standard streusel, baking it separately from the cake, and then merging them together at the end ... it doesn't really work unless I glue them together unless the cake itself is gluey (which isn't the case often) and making edible glue just isn't cost-effective for me (no local availability of certain ingredients outside of speciality stores with frankly ridiculous mark-up).\n",

I've just tried my hand at baking some ginger cookies (my first cookies baked on my own ever actually) ; I used brown sugar, fresh grated ginger, chopped crystallized ginger, kerrygold butter, the works. The dough tasted amazing so I thought I was fine. But on eating them out of the oven there's an acrid bitterness that I think is probably attributable to using 2 tsp baking soda instead of 1.

Instead of a house, I want to build a figure (don't want to \"reveal\" yet what exactly it is, but I promise to post it here if I succeed^^.

The hard part starts here: The figure must be standing upwards, ever so slightly leaning back. Obviously it won't stand just like that, but the lower part of the diamond will be supported by several small \"legs\", and it can also be slightly leaning on something for extra support, which however should be only about 1/4th of the length of the diamond.\n",

      "Hi everyone! After years of casual hand-mixing, I recently bought a KA Artisan Mini 3.5-qt tilt-head mixer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mixer itself works great, but there's something that's driving my OCD side insane: The attachments each reach significantly **different depths** in the bowl. The whisk is the only one that's perfect (barely clears the bottom); the **flex edge beater is quite short** by comparison, and the dough hook even more so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I often bake for just myself in **small batches** (hence my choice of the 3.5-qt Mini), the short reach of the beater and hook results in **poor to no mixing at the bottom** of the bowl. I imagine this would be a non-issue with larger batches, since the attachments would get a good hold of the bulk of the dough, and the dough itself would pick up the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the manual says that if the attachments aren't at the ideal barely-clearing-the-bottom height, you should **adjust the head height**. I did, but this created two new problems:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. When you turn the set screw clockwise to lower the head, you also create a gap between the head and the locking arm. **The more you lower the head**, the less the lock can hold it down, and **the more the head wobbles**.\n",
      "2. Because the attachments are inconsistent in height, if I lower the head to make the beater perfect (which to me is the most critical), the whisk bottoms out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem #1 is a deal breaker, since I can't have a wobbly head. I hate that the height adjustment has a direct effect on the locking mechanism, and that I **can't lower the head without also loosening the lock**. From the factory setting, the only true height adjustment one can make is upward, not downward, without ending up with a wobbly head.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a shame because, with the head slightly lowered, the beater works 100% perfectly for my needs: Not only does it mix all the way to the bottom, but the flex edge also better matches the curvature of the bowl, scraping the sides much better than at the factory height setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Short of making larger batches or going back to hand-mixing, is there either a hack you guys can recommend, or another brand of mixer whose attachments all reach the same depth or whose head can be lowered while staying tightly locked?\n",

I’ve had good luck with making laminated dough (and croissants using Weekend Bakery’s recipe), but I would like to use the dough for other viennoiseries as well.

It’s a bit difficult to reconcile the differences between the various recipes, so any general guidelines would be great, especially in relation to thickness (recipes never seem to give that).

I left it in for almost 10 minutes longer than the last one. Still showed all the signs of being done. Let it cool. Sliced the top. It seemed better. So I decided to bake two more layers, but one at a time. They cooled and i was skeptical because they just were slumping and looked kinda weird so, in still being able to use them if they were good, I trim it a little to get a taste. They. Were. Awful. Same gummy seemed underbaked, but how?! They were in so long. I followed the recipe. I’m familiar with my oven and know it’s temp.

It was so thick I struggled to mix it and had to recruit my boyfriend to do it. Straight out of the fridge, it was too thick to pipe. Even after microwaving, piping it was extremely difficult. Even at room temperature, it was more of a custard than a cream. **What made the pastry cream so thick?**\n",

      "- I ultimately had to use 4.5 eggs to get my choux pastry to a texture even vaguely like what I had seen online in videos. It was still potentially a bit thick, but I was able to get a decently long ribbon out of it at that point and it held it's shape well (and was easy to pipe). **Is it correct to assume I had to use more eggs due to regional differences?**\n",

During cooling, I cracked the oven door (I saw many recipes online suggest this) and cooled them for around 25 minutes. While cooling, they completely collapsed. **What happened to make my eclairs collapse and/or how can I keep it from happening next time?** (Note: This was the biggest issue by far as it made my eclairs unusable.) \n",

I’ve enjoyed some good loaves and some not so good. To be expected. So, I’ve been trying to up my hydration! Just for giggles.

I recently moved to south Texas and it has been hot and humid, so I felt like as I was trying to get the dough to rise in a warm spot (my garage) the dough would be too warm and I’d put it in the fridge and the next morning it would be over proofed from residual heat and I’d get the squatty loaves in the oven. Super bummer. My garage turns out.. is probably 85 degrees. I rose a loaf in my house today (around 75 degrees) and did bulk ferment and proof and bake all in one day. No fridge rest. After a 2 hour proof I did the poke test and I felt it maybe already overproofed! Again! Preheated oven, dumped out bread, watched it spread all over the parchment, scored the loaf haphazardly, it was so soft, and chucked it in the Dutch oven. \n",

Usually it's fine but I made cookies the other day and they werent.... that good. I followed the recipe but after watching What's Eating Dan on youtube and his vid about cookies I melted the margarine, used 1 egg white with 2 yolks (like he suggests) and it was super super super super dry. So I added in that other white as I hadn't tossed it yet and it moistened back up some. The other issue I think was that I guess we had dark brown sugar instead of light? I honestly don't know how much difference it makes on using one or the other but I can tell you instead of having like a usual crisp cookie it was kind of dense? It reminded me of a molasses cookie with it's consistency and I don't know what part of everything caused it. So yeah I guess this is kinda a \"how did I fuck it up\" and also \"what could I do to change it aside from using butter instead of margarine\". If it helps I love my cookies chewey n gooey.\n",

      "So I love outting interesting flavors into my cupcakes, and last Halloween I managed to make a green apple flavored buttercream that tasted exactly like a sour apple, the extract was expensive though. I'm planning on trying to make my own with jolly ranchers or other high flavor candies in vodka to make my own extracts. I have a need to make either watermelon cake pops or strawberry lemonade ones, and I'm wondering how you think the flavor would be if I put a bit of the extracts in to the candy melts coating the cake pops?

Any other candies you think that would make some yummy extracts for baking?\n",

I tried to give an extra stir in the pan, but I think this was an obvious problem of the first attempt.  The cake rose very high in the oven but started to shrink not long after i turned it.  My guess is the high point was about 3x the volume of the original batter.  By the time I took the cake out it was about 2x the volume of the original batter (didn't seem like a complete deal breaker?  I'm not sure....  I'm quite new to baking).\n",

My oven usually runs pretty close to the temperature I set it at, but I didn't have my thermometer in last night to double check.  The fall always happened at some point after the turn.  My guess is the temperature is ok, but that the fluctuation is too dramatic when i turn the cake?  I might wait longer to turn it or even not turn it at all?

      " I'm still struggling to make good pancakes. I'm very close after using [this recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/216755/extra-yummy-fluffy-pancakes/), but it's not the buttery kind I remember so fondly. I'm not overmixing the batter, so I'm suspecting the issue is in how the batter is cooked. I'm using a non-stick pan sprayed with cooking spray over a low to medium heat on a gas stove. The pan is in good condition (none of the coating is flaking off), and I'm watching the edges carefully and flipping it once the bubbles really get going.\n",

      "Hello, I am pretty good at baking all sorts of things but have been afraid to try breads with yeast for a long time because it seems so complex. I had a goal to learn to bake a polish cheese babka for my family before easter. Given that easter is in like a week, I dont think this is going to be perfect by then! But I'm still trying. My family used to get this bread at a polish bakery all the time but it has fallen out of fashion I think and the chocolate and cinnamon type dense babkas have become more popular. The last few years it has been basically impossible to get. The only stores I can find it are at like supermarkets around easter time and of course they are loaded with preservatives and junk. So I thought, maybe I could learn to make it and release my family from this frustration!!! \n",

I am following a recipe here https://hostessatheart.com/cheese-babka-twelveloaves/ but I have baked it twice and found the texture is not what I'm used to. If I didn't stuff it with sweet cheese, it would taste to me like a regular old white bread. It's good. But it's not the babka type texture, which is meant to be light and soft. I have tried kneading the dough more this time around. It think its a bit softer but still not what I was looking for. It rises great both times and bakes well. I have also seen some other recipes that use more flour and egg yolks instead of whole eggs. I tried to search for things like, what makes bread soft but all the websites that came up seem to say its about not rising enough or not kneading enough. Is it possible I'm still not kneading enough??? How long do you knead for? I think I did for like 3-5 minutes. The rise seemed fine so I dont think its my yeast. This is the other recipie I found https://www.beneaththecrust.com/blog/2018/3/27/sweet-cheese-babka This one has the crumb topping, which is also usually a hallmark of cheese babka. Would the egg yolks make the texture better? I noticed mine is not as yellow as others I have had. Maybe its because they are using yolks? New to this reddit, sorry for the book!

The easiest way is just to package them in their own syrup, but I would like something a bit less gooey/bulky.

Obviously, once the sugar begins to crystallize there is very little time left before the syrup is completely seized. In my experience, what time there is typically leaves a glaze that is large in crystal structure and not at all shiny. \n",

      "I recently got a Kitchenaid bowl-lift stand mixer and I was immensely frustrated with it. The instructions say that it should be able to handle whipping only 2 eggs whites, but that wasn't the case. I took the bowl out and hand whipped the egg whites to get some volume, in the hope that after that I'd be able to use the stand mixer for the rest of the recipe. This wasn't the case. Furthermore, the bowl was high and narrow; I couldn't even get my cream of tartar directly into the bowl without it all sticking to the sides or ending up in the top portion of the whisk. Although this isn't the end of the world with cream of tartar, it would be a much bigger issue with other ingredients. Stopping the machine, lowering the bowl, and adding ingredients is an option, but also a pain. It was also a fight to get the bowl into position.\n",

      "I'm going to be making an oreo cheesecake for my uncle's birthday in a few days. The filling itself will be no-bake but the base will be an oreo brownie (I won't be making it too thick). I was thinking of using cake flour instead of all purpose flour for the oreo brownie base for a more softer base so it's easier to cut into. Would that be a wise thing to do or should I just stick with all purpose flour? Or maybe I could go half and half of each?\n",

Is there another icing/glaze that sets similar to royal icing (wouldn't smear all over a box, for example) but is a little creamier perhaps? Or has somebody decorated breads with royal icing before? Did the textures go well together?\n",

I was thinking about just folding a quantity of PB into the brownie batter (perhaps after softening the PB a bit by heating it) before baking.  However, a quick Google search seems to indicate that most people advocate incorporating peanut butter into brownies by drizzling it onto the top (or in the middle).  Is this preference for presentation purposes, or is there some technical reason why folding it into the batter would yield a poor result?\n",
